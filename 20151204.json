In the year ended March, Indian exports of cars, trucks, buses and two-wheelers rose 15 percent to about 3.6 million, industry data showed.\nCarmakers such as Hyundai, India'a biggest car exporter, BMW, Renault and Nissan have production facilities in just one Indian city and this incident could force them to consider forming a more sustainable continuity plan, said Majeed.\n\"Climate is a big issue ... Manufacturers will need to think about de-risking,\" he said, adding that as exports from India rise, carmakers may need to think about having two or more plants.\nIncessant rainfall in the country's fourth most-populous city, a major auto production hub dubbed India's Detroit, has killed at least 269 people and cut off more than three million people from basic services.\nNatural disasters have disrupted Asia's auto industry in the past. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami in Japan hit car production, and floods in Thailand the same year impacted auto part makers affecting vehicles produced in North America.\nEicher Motors , maker of the Royal Enfield motorcycle, lost production of 4,000 two-wheelers in November. \"The floods caused by the rain have also impacted logistics and our supply-chain,\" it said in a statement on Thursday.\nApollo Tyres stock price\nOn December 11, 2015, Apollo Tyres closed at Rs 148.55, down Rs 2.75, or 1.82 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 249.45 and the 52-week low was Rs 146.90.\nThe company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 15.50 per share as per the quarter ended September 2015.
