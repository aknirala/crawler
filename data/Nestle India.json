Nestle is estimated to have taken a hit of Rs 450 crore and had to destroy over 30,000 tonnes of the instant noodles.\n\"The MAGGI issue disrupted business during the year and the shock is much larger than what the company alone has faced or what our results have indicated. It impacted thousands of workers, suppliers, partners, farmers, distributors, truckers, retailers and other stakeholders who constitute the Maggi brand,\" a spokesperson for Nestle India said.\nImpacted by the ban, Nestle India reported a standalone loss of Rs 64.40 crore in the April-June quarter for the first time in 15 years. In the subsequent quarter, its standalone net profit dipped by over 60 per cent.\nThe Maggi ban impacted instant noodles business of other companies as well including the conglomerate ITC.\n\"The instant noodles category was impacted and witnessed a significant decline in sales volume when the controversy broke out,\" an ITC spokesperson said. At the same time, the FMCG companies including HUL , ITC, Marico and Dabur were facing challenges of low demand on account of dip in the rural income due to scattered rains bundled with deflation of commodity prices in 2015, which forced them to slash the price of soaps and detergents and increase spending on advertising and promotions.\nAlthough, there was general optimism about the overall economy, this was not seen getting translated into higher consumer spending. Many FMCG firms also faced liquidity issues due to an overall increase in cost of funds. The only silver lining was seen in the urban markets where modern retail chains and e-commerce boom emerged as new lucrative sales channels for them.\nThe companies are now betting on these channels to expand to rural markets as well. According to the latest government data, the consumer non-durables sector saw a growth of only 0.1 per cent during the six months period of April to October, as against 1.1 per cent growth in the same period of last year.\n\u00a0\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:30 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5841.10, down Rs 29.2, or 0.5 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 7499.95 and the 52-week low was Rs 5499.00.\nThe company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 73.27 per share as per the quarter ended September 2015. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 79.72. The latest book value of the company is Rs 294.27 per share.

Both Gujarat and Karnataka have lifted ban on manufacturing and sale of Maggi.\nLast week, the Indian arm of the FMCG major received favourable results from all three laboratories mandated by Bombay High Court to test noodles samples.\nHowever, Nestle had said that it will start selling Maggi noodles only after the newly manufactured products are also cleared by the designated three laboratories.\nSo, how to trade Nestle now?\nNomura maintains buy rating on the stock and believes that Maggi noodles should be seen on the shelves soon. It says that there would be a short-term impact on sales and profitability of the company for a few quarters, but the company should be able to fix the product and bring it back to the market.\nIt is convinced that it will not have a long-term impact on Nestle's brand value. The brokerage has a target price\u00a0 of Rs 6950 per share.\nICICIdirect.com recommends buying the stock with a target price of Rs 7240 per share.\nHowever, Religare reiterates sell rating with a target price of Rs 5500 due to its rich valuations.\nIn August 2015, the court had asked that Maggi noodles be newly tested in three independent labs in Hyderabad, Mohali and Jaipur.

of Cadbury Flake Cones, Rowntree's Fruit Pastille lollies and Kelly's Cornish ice cream, was in talks with Nestle to form a 50/50 joint venture in a 3 billion euro (USD 3.4 billion) deal.\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nNestle is in \"advanced discussions\" to merge its international ice cream business with R&R Ice Cream, in its latest effort to refocus on other, higher-performing brands.\nThe world's largest packaged food company announced the talks on Monday, after agency reported that R&R, maker of Cadbury Flake Cones, Rowntree's Fruit Pastille lollies and Kelly's Cornish ice cream, was in talks with Nestle to form a 50/50 joint venture in a 3 billion euro (USD 3.4 billion) deal.\nNestle said it will contribute its ice cream businesses in Europe, Egypt, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina, as well as its European frozen food businesses, excluding pizza but including products like frozen cake brand Erlenbacher.\nAll of UK-based R&R, owned by French private equity firm PAI, will go into the joint venture that will be equally owned by both parties.\n\"It's good news and in line with what they started to do four or five years ago,\" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said. \"We've been pushing for that for a long time, but I thought they would never get rid of ice cream.\"\nBesides being far off Nestle's goal of becoming a \"nutrition, health and wellness\" company, its ice cream business is a distant No. 2 to world leader Unilever and always had weaker returns than other businesses, he said.\nMass-market ice cream is under pressure as consumer tastes shift toward healthy, fresh food or premium brands, opening up the market to smaller players.\nNestle's share of the global market, worth USD 67 billion, is 10.8 percent, less than half of Unilever's and down from 12.8 percent in 2010, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. R&R has a 0.8 percent share.\nNestle oversees a sprawling portfolio including Gerber baby food, Nescafe coffee, KitKat bars and Purina pet food. That diversification has helped it weather the global economic downturn better than some other companies.\nStill, like Unilever and Procter & Gamble, Nestle has been reviewing its portfolio, getting rid of underperforming brands. Over the past two years it has parted with most of its Jenny Craig diet food business, Power Bar snacks, Juicy Juice drink in the US, its frozen food business in Spain and its ice cream business in South Africa.\nAnalysts said that Nestle could next look at doing something similar with its US frozen food business, which includes brands like Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine, as it has been struggling in recent years.\nHISTORY TOGETHER\nNestle's ice cream business includes more than 150 brands including Movenpick, Nestle Scholler and Extreme. Its ice cream operations in the United States, which include Haagen-Dazs, Edy's and Dreyer's, will not be part of the deal.\nThe new partnership will combine Nestle's distribution network with R&R's more efficient manufacturing. It will operate in over 20 countries and employ more than 10,000 people.\nNestle and R&R have history together. R&R, or Richmond as it used to be known, bought Nestle's UK ice cream business in 2001, giving it brands including Fab and Smarties.\nTerms of the latest deal and its advisors were not disclosed. But a source familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that Credit Suisse was advising Nestle, while PAI was being advised by Rothschild. Both banks declined to comment.\nThe plan is for PAI to exit in a few years' time and for Nestle to list the business, the source added.\nPAI bought R&R, Europe's largest private-label ice cream maker, in 2013 from Oaktree Capital Management for around 850 million euros. Private equity firms typically aim to own businesses for four to six years.\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:37 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5850.00, down Rs 20.3, or 0.35 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 7499.95 and the 52-week low was Rs 5499.00.\nThe company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 73.27 per share as per the quarter ended September 2015. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 79.84. The latest book value of the company is Rs 294.27 per share.

The company opposed the government's suit saying that due to the ban, around 9,000 vendors and 10,000 suppliers were rendered unemployed and it has suffered a loss of nearly Rs 250 crore.\n\"It has caused a huge damage to our reputation... to the extent that my competitors are making fun of me (company). While my product has been banned, government is not taking any action against any manufacturer of similar products... I am being singled out,\" senior advocate Arvind Nigam said on behalf of the company.\nOn August 17, NCDRC had issued notice to Nestle on the government's suit to which the company had to reply today.\nHowever, the company failed to reply to the notice claiming that it has not received complete documents from the government to which it had to filed its reply.\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:37 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5850.00, down Rs 20.3, or 0.35 percent.

Compromise is only solution\nThe real problem of food safety lies not in our laws, but in our inability to create enough testing systems with adequate manpower to do the job consistently and fairly.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nHow can Nestle jump Maggi ban? Compromise is only solution\nThe real problem of food safety lies not in our laws, but in our inability to create enough testing systems with adequate manpower to do the job consistently and fairly.\nPost your opinion here\nR Jagannathan\nFirstpost.com\nThe Union consumer affairs ministry\u2019s decision to launch a class action suit against Nestle , makers of Maggi noodles, in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) will be an important test case for such actions in the future.\nHowever, it is in the best interests of the regulators, Nestle and consumers to come to a compromise solution rather than litigate endlessly.\nNestle was forced to withdraw its Maggi stocks from all over the country in June this year following the discovery of lead above acceptable levels in some samples, and a label that said \u201cNo added MSG\u201d. While tests of Maggi noodles sent outside the country to Singapore, Canada and the US appear to have passed their more stringent food safety tests, Nestle\u2019s real battleground is India, where it is contesting the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India\u2019s (FSSAI\u2019s) order and claims that Maggi can be hazardous to health.\nThe class action suit, which seeks Rs 640 crore in damages from Nestle on behalf of consumers, has two dimensions \u2013 one positive, and the other negative. The positive one is the message it sends out about stronger government action on food safety standards. But this will be credible only if the government follows up the action against Nestle with similar actions involving other food products. Also, class action suits have not had a track-record in India; the suit by the ministry may thus be a shot in the dark.\nThe negative dimension is the possibility that the government may have chosen to make its point with the wrong company \u2013 a multinational that is normally known to follow higher standards than domestic producers. It can have implications for how foreign companies view India as a fair and safe place to do business in.\nIt is possible that the class action suit launched by the consumer affairs ministry was intended to pressure Nestle to settle the case out of court so that there is no inordinate delay in the reintroduction of a suitably relabelled and reformulated Maggi.\nThe salutary effects of the action against Maggi are already visible in the area of milk, where the FSSAI and milk cooperatives have agreed to increase checks and quality standards for milk delivered. According to this Business Standard report , the FSSAI and representatives of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) have agreed to implement better quality checks and the government testing facilities needed to enforce those standards.\nThis is critical, for the key element in ensuring quality is not just the care taken by food manufacturers at their end, but the quality of the testing facilities available with the regulators in states and the FSSAI. Nestle, for example, has raised doubts about the accuracy of FSSAI\u2019s testing laboratories. Despite failing tests in some labs in India, Maggi jumped over the hurdles in Singapore, USA and Canada.\nSince it cannot be anyone\u2019s claim that India\u2019s food safety standards, regulation and supervision are better than that of the US, Canada and Singapore, the class action suit seems more like an effort to push Nestle to compromise in order to spare our regulator the blushes in case Nestle gets the courts to lend it a more sympathetic ear.\nHowever, the negative fallout of trying to pressure Nestle is that no one outside India will believe that the regulatory process here is fair and transparent. This will damage the country\u2019s efforts to tell the world that we are a safe place to do business in.\nThe concurrent agreement reached with the NDDB will also suggest that when it pleases the regulator and government, deals will be done in consultation with industry.\nIs there a way out for the FSSAI, the government and Nestle? The only answer is a compromise where Nestle is allowed to restart production and marketing of Maggi after proper testing and reformulation of its products, and a simultaneous agreement between the two on how the products will be inspected and tested in future, and with what equipment.\nThe real problem of food safety lies not in our laws, but in our inability to create enough testing systems with adequate manpower to do the job consistently and fairly. We do not have a regulator who can regulate effectively. As a result, it is the oddball result \u2013 as in the case of Maggi \u2013 that is seen as a great achievement.\nAs this writer has noted before , Indian food is largely unsafe for human consumption. Toxic food is sold everywhere, from contaminated milk to fruits and vegetables that bear an overdose of pesticides, to bhujias and junk food that are simply unhealthy for all people, leave alone kids.\nNowhere is the problem worse than in the case of milk \u2013 a product fundamental to Indian children\u2019s health, especially those born in vegetarian families. Many producers and distributors adulterate milk to increase profits and to make the product look thick. In Maharashtra, the Food and Drug Administration found that 24 percent of the samples tested in Pune division some time back were either unsafe or did not conform to the standards set by FS&SAI. But we continue to drink this poison in the name of health.\nSome diaries inject hormones or insulin into buffaloes because this helps make the milk thicker. But insulin also gets into the milk, which makes it unsafe for women and children. In Andhra Pradesh, milk samples tested by a private laboratory found traces of urea, coliform, e-coli and salmonella (many of them harmful bacteria), but the milk diaries faced no action. Unlike Maggi, which is being withdrawn at huge cost, how many milk producers have been ordered to throw their milk away because it is sub-standard?\nAnd it isn\u2019t about milk alone. The New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment found that junk food \u2013 like burgers and bhujias \u2013 contains high levels of trans-fats (very harmful), salt and sugar, which could lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\nMost ordinary hotel kitchens are unhygienic, and street food is often sold next to gutters and garbage in big cities. Branded Kurkure may be made in hygienic factories, but potato chips and namkeen are often made inside slums or dirty factories, often with low-quality ingredients and oil, in order to sell them cheap. We pay a price in terms of health for buying and consuming \u201ccheap\u201d food.\nThe short point is this: food and health safety, despite the existence of standards and regulations, is badly in need of strong supervision and enforcement of the law.\nThe states are the real culprits, as food safety has to be enforced by them. The Maggi problem was discovered by a food inspector in Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, but the chances are this discovery was an accident or an exception. The reason why bad and unhygienic food goes unchecked is corruption. It is simply too easy for food manufacturers to bribe inspectors and continue doing what they are doing: selling poison for profit. For small food sellers, the cost of complying with the law is simply too high compared with the ease of paying a bribe.\nThere are only three ways to combat food adulteration. First, the public must be educated on this. Second, packaged food makers and hotels must be sensitised to improve hygiene standards by the use of better technology and safer ingredients. And third, we simply need many thousands of food inspectors and foolproof testing equipment of the highest quality to ensure fair and effective quality standards.\nWe need quality standards in our testing equipment as much as in our food.\nThe writer is editor-in-chief, digital and publishing, Network18 Group.\n", "title": "How can Nestle jump Maggi ban?

Moreover, foreign investors poured a mere Rs 547 crore in Indian capital markets during April-June quarter, after pumping in a whopping Rs 79,000 crore in the preceding three months.\nHowever, the report said that FII inflow is expected to improve, but at a tepid pace, in the second quarter of the current fiscal (2015-16).\nAccording to the report,\"key factors that can stimulate FII flows in the second quarter are : receding fears of a global financial shock due to a mismanaged Grexit and a sharp US interest rate lift-off and relative attractiveness of India vis-a-vis emerging markets.\n\"However, the bearish outlook for emerging markets due to a crash in Chinese markets, gradual US rate hike and domestic concerns - weak first quarter earnings, prospects of below average monsoon, slowing reform agenda (due to disruptions in Parliament) \u00a0may cap the resurgence in FII flows,\" it added.\nOf the 50 Nifty companies, FIIs trimmed stake in 41 stocks, while the report did not specify ownership status of the remaining 10 firms.\n\"They have trimmed their holdings in 41 Nifty stocks and reduced their holdings quite significantly (over 2 percent ) in five stocks - Hindalco, Bank of Baroda, TTMT, Hero Motocorp and Zee Entertainment,\" the report noted.\nDuring the first quarter, top FII 'buys' were Sun Pharma , Eicher Motors , Bharti Airtel , Lupin and Reliance Industries , while top 'sell' list are Infosys , Axis Bank , HDFC , Nestle India and Hero Motocorp.

These samples were first sent to Goa-based Food and Drugs Laboratory and later to Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI).\nWhile the lead content has been found to be within permissible limits of test reports of CFTRI, FSSAI said: \"A\u00a0perusal of the tests results from CFTRI, Mysore shows that the said samples have not been tested for MSG.\"\nIt further said, Nestle has not responded to the show cause notice of June 5. The regulator also said that Nestle had informed earlier that all their Maggi noodles for exports to eight countries were manufactured only at the Goa factory.\n\"Part of the local domestic supplies, including 4 out of 5 samples tested, were also from the product manufactured at the Bicholim (Goa) factory,\" FSSAI said in a statement.\nIn June, FSSAI had banned Maggi noodles only after it found 30

The company's newly appointed Managing Director, Suresh Narayanan, who officially took over the role on Saturday, said at a media briefing that bringing Maggi back to the market was at the top on his five-point agenda. When asked if the company will consider introducing an alternative snacks category under Maggi brand, he said: \"If it all makes sense, why not?\" He, however, added it would depend on whether those products are commercially viable.\n\"In Maggi itself there are couple of ideas on which we are working. In other products categories there are couple of ideas that we have got,\" he said without sharing details. Reiterating that Nestle \"spends maximum amount on R&D\" worldwide, he said there are a number of projects currently underway.\nThe Maggi ban has affected sales of other categories too and the company was looking to drive growth of those categories, he said. \"For me what is going to be the key focus is on growing some of other categories as well. We have got presence in dairy, presence in coffee and beverages and we have got presence in chocolate and confectioneries as well.\nThere are opportunities there,\" Narayanan said. He, however, said the company was not diluting the importance of Maggi as it is \"is a big part of our movement\". On the impact on other categories, he said: \"There has been impact on the rest of the portfolio because it is also sold in similar outlets and in similar geographies.\nI can say that it has been reasonably uniform across all the categories. Uniformally it has affected.\" As part of his five point agenda, Narayanan said Nestle India would also focus on enhanced engagement with stakeholders and authorities and communities. When asked if the company is increasing marketing spend to counter impact of Maggi ban on on other brands, he said: \"That's part of the thinking really to shore up what really we can do on some of the other parts of the portfolio...\nOne part of the portfolio is affected but we will be looking as to how we can shore up advertising and support activities on the other brands\".\n", "title": "New products, higher ad spend on Nestle's revival agenda", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/new-products-higher-ad-spendnestles-revival-agenda_2286581.html", "time": "4.00 pm "}, {"date": " 01 Aug 2015", "content": "Aug 03, 2015, 08.57 PM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nNew Nestle chief's first job: 'Bring Maggi noodles back'\nNestle, the foods company that has had a 103-year presence in India, is undergoing its worst crisis ever and its new country head is focused on fighting it and emerging stronger.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nNew Nestle chiefs first job: Bring Maggi noodles back\nNestle, the foods company that has had a 103-year presence in India, is undergoing its worst crisis ever and its new country head is focused on fighting it and emerging stronger.\nPost your opinion here\nSpecial Show\nNestle , the foods company that has had a 103-year presence in India, is undergoing its worst crisis ever and its new country head is focused on fighting it and emerging stronger.\nThe company's iconic Maggi noodles -- which had a 70 percent market share in its Rs 3,800-crore segment, and which contributed about 30 percent to the company's revenues -- is off the shelves, after it was banned by several state food regulators amid reports it contained unusually high levels of lead and monosodium glutamate.\nA few days after\u00a0taking over as the managing director of Nestle India, Suresh Narayanan sat down with CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan, and explained that his \"first mandate was to bring Maggi noodles back in the market\" and that his company would work overtime to make sure it meets customers' expectations on quality.\nBut he steered cleared of getting into the minutiae of the Maggi noodles case -- except to say that Nestle was utmost focused on quality and that it would focus on boost it further in the future.\nHe did comment on the financial impact of the crisis -- in the first quarter, the company's sales declined 20 percent to Rs 1,933 crore and it posted a net loss (of Rs 64 crore) for the first time in 15 years -- and said that most of the one-time impact, such as that incurred for destroying 27,000 tonnes of noodles, were booked during the quarter.\nUsing the never-let-a-crisis-go-waste philosophy, Narayanan also said that Nestle would look to revamp its product strategy: it is likely to look at changing the product mix for Maggi noodles once it is brought back as well as intensify its push into other segments such as nutrition and drinks.\nBelow is the transcript of Suresh Narayanan\u2019s interview with Shereen Bhan on CNBC-TV18.\nQ: What was the kind of lead time that you were given before you were asked to move to India?\nA: A couple of weeks; but I would just like to add that the whole process of leadership transition is part of something that we work on as a global company. So, I have moved to different geographies, I have gained different experiences and management of challenges be it the environment, or be it the market my last one was an Egypt; four and a half years of, you can imagine the kind of challenges that we faced. It was felt that- that would be a relevant kind of experience to bring to bear in the Indian Market in the current context and here I am.\nQ: So you would say this is more of a strategic and not just a tactical move and I ask you this in the context of the commentary that is already coming in as you takeover at Nestle India? The view is I am reading out of comments that have been made by various analysts who track the company that an Indian origin Managing Director will be able to understand and manage the issue related to the Maggie ban better? So is it tactical or more strategic the move to India?\nA: I would reckon that probably I hope I have got skills that are more compelling than just being an Indian. I believe that in the experienced profile that I have built up in the organisation it has been relevant to take on the kind of challenges that bring me to this market. While I know that this is a question that probably Paul Bulcke and my boss Wallin Mattias should be answering. However, I think my being an Indian has kind of as she says being the cheery on the cake. I think it enables and facilitates a certain ease in which I am able to adapt myself to the environment and that helps.\nQ: Speaking of adaptability and I came back to the strategic thinking behind moving you here because you are the first Indian to takeover Nestle India in a 17 year period and this issue of whether they should actually be an Indian at the helm of Nestle India has been talked about for a while. In fact if I go back to the reports dated January 2014 again analyst were talking about the need to bring in an Indian at the helm of affairs perhaps because cultural insights, customer insights would be more apt in Nestle the impression is was losing out on innovation and losing out on a connect with the consumers so again my question in a larger strategic context.\nA: One of the charms of being the Nestle organisation is the fact that our talent is multinational. As much as I was given the opportunity of being the Managing Director in Singapore or in Egypt or in the Philippines is the opportunity that is given to a lot of my colleagues on global bases to go ahead up operations in different parts of the world.\nSo I do not think that there has been any unconscious kind of decision saying no, we will not look at a local for a local market. As and when it becomes relevant in the context of the experience that has been build up and if there is a local that is capable of a taking on the challenge of managing a market it happens. I think it has been more been in that context.\nQ: Let us talk about the current crisis that you have to deal with and that is of course what happens now as far as the brand Nestle is concerned post the Maggi controversy. You have said we will overcome, you have said it is your mandate to build this company brick by brick, employee by employee, customer by customer, what does that mean exactly?\nA: To me I look at this as a mission and not a job and to me that is important because I have been born from this team and I believe that there is a lot of people around me in this organization who can and truly will make a difference. So I look at their mandate in terms of four-five key objectives that I seem to achieve. Number one is to bring Maggi back and that is a clear path of the mandate that I will be working on.\nQ: If I can ask you to halt there so that I can flesh this point out. When you say your mandate is to bring Maggi back, what will it take to bring Maggi back as far as India is concerned, the domestic market is concerned, I am not talking about the court issue because the court matter is subjudice, the order is reserved but what will it take from a company\\\\'s point of view, from a regulatory approvals point of view to get Maggi back on the shelf?\nA: There are two parts to it. First one is to engage with the regulatory authorities in terms of the product itself which post the judgement is a matter that we will work. My whole approach has been to find the solution to the way forward. I think we have to find the solution to the way forward and the dialogue that we will be engaged would be around finding that.\nQ: When you say the effort is to find the solution irrespective of what the court decides, are they likely to see you change formulation whether it is the tastemaker or the noodles itself, are you working on that at this point of time, are we likely to see an effort to rebrand for instance, repackage this whole business, there is no addition as far as MSG is concerned, you have been accused of mislabelling, what is going to be the effort on each of those specifics?\nA: I think at the moment it is a bit speculative for me to say whether which part of the marketing mix will we be addressing -- I think the mandate that we have is to look at all elements, look at the element in terms of the product, in terms of the offering, in terms of the packaging, in terms of the communication, there has been of course clearly some confusion as far as the consumer is concerned on Maggi brand. That is an area that will be early taken by us in terms of revamping and relooking at the scope of communication and engagement that we will do in order to get back.\nQ: Even though you maintain that you are within permissible levels of lead.\n\u00a0A: The correction is we are safe.\nQ: You are safe but are you looking at reworking the product formulation given the apprehensions that have been expressed by the food regulator?\nA: That would certainly be part of the scope of divisions that will be taken.\nQ: Are you awaiting the court verdict in order for you to act on that?\nA: We already start working on the project from Day 1. It is for an organization with the depth of capabilities that we have and initiative that has been undertaken already and there are options and there are discussions and there are discussions that are actively on in order to see the different elements of the mix and what can we do in a situation to take things forward.\nQ: So what will be step number two? One would be the identify one of those scenarios that you are working with, those options that you have already identified which would maybe entail a change as far as product formulation is concerned, what is step two, regulatory approval?\nA: Step two would be to engage regulatory bodies and here I think the approach is that I have is, we have been in this country, Nestle has been in this country for over a 100 years. We want to be here for the next 100-200 years whatever span of time we can have. We are part of this country, 99.7 percent of the employees of Nestle India are Indian starting from me. So as far as I am concerned, we are well within the laws of the land, we will be respecting every single aspect of the law of the land and we will be there for engaging in a dialogue to ensure that what comes out is the best product in terms of quality, safey and longevity for the consumer.\nQ: What will that mean then from a production standpoint and once you do get regulatory approvals, as and when you do get them, how soon can we see you put production back onto shelf?\nA: Today the entire value chain of Maggi is frozen so we have five factories that are not functioning. We have got suppliers who are not supplying and we have got distribution network that are sub-optimal because the fact is that don\u2019t carry Maggi, I look at it from the point of view of getting all this back -- there are a detailed exercises that are on to see what would be the kind of ramp up time because it is like literally stopping the machines and starting it once again.\nQ: So what would be the ballpark ramp up?\nA: For me I would like to speculate because it also depends on the different options that we are playing with but I can only assure you that we want to be back with Maggi at the soonest.\nQ: Would it be safe to say that pending regulatory approvals, pending getting the Maggi ecosystem if I could call it that back in place, the end of this calendar year perhaps the earliest we could see Maggi back on track?\nA: I would again in realm of possibility but at this stage, I would say it is probably a bit speculation because I think a lot will depend on what comes out of what we are going to hear from the honourable court and taking that forward, in terms of a proactive engagement, an engagement where we find a solution that is forward looking in the interest of the consumer, in the interest of the country and in the interest of the company.\nQ: Are you still exporting Maggi because you have got the clean chit from regulators in Singapore, you have got the clean chit from regulators in Canada, as well as the UK, you were exporting Maggi from the domestic manufacturing facilities from India, are you still exporting Maggi?\nA: Yes we have started it albeit modestly but this is definitely part of the ambit as far as the company is concerned.\nQ: So when you talk about options and you talk about resurrecting the brand image so to speak, there is no question of doing away with the Maggi brand?\nA: No, Maggi is a vital part of the portfolio of Nestle. So the question of doing away with Maggi simply doesn\u2019t arrive. It is a bit like saying Narayanan of Suresh. It is a part of the fabric of this organisation.\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:42 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5850.00, down Rs 20.3, or 0.35 percent.

Tuesday told the Bombay High Court that Maggi noodles manufacturer Nestle India violated laws with the lead level in the popular instant snack being above the permissible limit.\nThe court was hearing a petition filed by Nestle against FSSAI's June 5 order banning nine variants of Maggi, and Maharashtra government's order prohibiting their sale.\n\"If they (Nestle) had problems with the FDA report of laboratory tests showing lead content in Maggi, they could have told us, following which we could have referred the case to other accredited labs.\nInstead, the company challenged our authority,\" argued FDA counsel Darius Khambata. He further said, to a question by the judges, that of the 20 samples which were sent to the labs, only five tested positive.\nTo another question by the division bench of justices V M Kanade and B P Colabawalla, Khambata said FDA had tested only two variants of Maggi, but banned all the nine variants available in the market.\nHe would continue the argument on Wednesday.\nThe lawyer of Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had earlier argued that it had not banned Maggi, but only asked the company to stop the manufacture and sale as it contained lead beyond the permissible limit.\nFSSAI also said that it was ready to give a hearing to the company.\nBoth FSSAI and FDA have claimed that they had issued notices to Nestle India keeping in mind the health hazards the product may have had due to the high lead content.\nNestle has argued that a particular batch may have contained lead beyond permissible limit but the blanket ban was \"unfair and illegal\".\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:43 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5850.00, down Rs 20.3, or 0.35 percent.

In all, 72 samples were tested and 30 of them were found to contain lead beyond the permissible limit, he said.\nTo a question by Justice B P Colabawalla, Singh said FSSAI had tested three variants of Maggi.\n\"If three variants were tested, then why should you ban all the nine variants? Also, why only Maggi was selected for the test and why not other noodle manufacturing companies?\" the judge said.\n\"From what you say, the quality of 30 samples of Maggi was found to be sub-standard, but 42 other samples were found to be in order,\" the judge noted.\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:43 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5850.00, down Rs 20.3, or 0.35 percent.

He will take the reins on Aug. 1.\nAnalysts had been expecting a change in leadership for the business, which was widely criticised for its slow response to consumer worries over safety.\nThe company withdrew the noodles from the shelves of Indian stores last month. It has since challenged the findings of India's food safety authority in court.\n\"An Indian in India is able to possibly interact better with the government at large,\" said brand strategist Harish Bijoor.\nNestle has been at the centre of India's worst food scare in a decade, after a regulator in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in May found excess lead in a sample of its popular Maggi noodles.\nThe Swiss firm had to bring group chief executive Paul Bulcke to calm consumers at a televised press conference last month, where he was frequently shouted down by Indian reporters.\nBulcke acknowledged the company had slipped in the way it handled the food scare. \"If you have confusion there is something wrong with communications. That's why we are sitting here,\" he said at the event.\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:43 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5850.00, down Rs 20.3, or 0.35 percent.

The hearing was adjourned until then by the bench.\nNestle has argued that a certain batch of Maggi may have contained lead beyond permissible limit but the decision to impose a blanket ban was \"unfair and illegal.\"\nThe company has claimed that it had tested the product in 2,700 laboratories in India and also abroad and the tests indicated that the lead content was less than the permissible limit of 0.5 on Friday.\nNestle stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:43 hrs Nestle India was quoting at Rs 5850.00, down Rs 20.3, or 0.35 percent.

regulator FSSAI proposed banning sale of these products as 'medicines' and announced new norms for products based on ayurveda, sidhha, unani and other traditional health systems.\nUnder the new draft regulations announced late, the companies can't claim that their nutraceuticals and health supplement products are for therapeutic and curative purposes.\n\"Every package of food or health supplements shall carry the words FOOD or HEALTH SUPPLEMENT... the term \u0091NOT FOR MEDICINAL USE\u0092 shall be prominently written on the label,\" as per a draft order issued by FSSAI, which recently created a flutter by banning the popular Maggi noodles.\nFood Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also proposed the maximum usage levels for cow's milk, buffalo's milk, camel's milk, ghee, curd, butter, honey, gold, gold foil, silver, pearl in ayurveda, siddha and unani ingredients based products.\nThe limit has been fixed as maximum usage levels per day for use as a health or food supplements which are based on ayurveda, siddha and unani.\nThe regulator will finalise the safety norms after receiving comments from all stakeholders on the draft note.\nFSSAI said that the benefits of specialty foods containing ingredients based on ayurveda, unani and siddha and other traditional health systems of India, should be shown by science based evidence.\nOn Thursday, industry body Assocham had released a knowledge paper suggesting that FSSAI should come up with safety norms for nutraceuticals and dietary supplements.\nIn the paper, the industry body said about 60-70 percent supplements in the nutraceuticals market, which has potential to grow to USD 12.2 billion in the next five years, are fake and such unregistered and unapproved products should be recalled.\nIndia accounts for 1.5 percent of the global nutraceuticals market.

In all, 72 samples were tested and 30 of them were found to contain lead beyond the permissible limit, he said.\nTo a question by Justice B P Colabawalla, Singh said FSSAI had tested three variants of Maggi. \"If three variants were tested, then why should you ban all the nine variants? Also, why only Maggi was selected for the test and why not other noodle manufacturing companies?\" the judge said.\n\"From what you say, the quality of 30 samples of Maggi was found to be sub-standard, but 42 other samples were found to be in order,\" the judge noted.\nThe FSSAI counsel argued that after the lab tests found\u00a0that Maggi contained lead beyond permissible limit, the food\u00a0regulator immediately issued order asking Nestle to stop\u00a0manufacture and sale.\nHowever, it also issued Nestle a notice asking why the\u00a0approval granted to Maggie should not be cancelled in the wake\u00a0of such tests, said advocate Singh.\n\"We have not asked Nestle to withdraw the product...we\u00a0have only asked them to stop production and sale of Maggi,\"\u00a0the counsel said.\nFSSAI was entitled to ban the production because under\u00a0FSSAI Act it has powers to do so, he submitted.\u00a0\"We found lead content in 30 samples of Maggi to be\nbeyond the permissible limit and this is dangerous to public\u00a0health.\nIn such a situation, there was no need to give the\u00a0company a show-cause notice and hear it. Hence, the impugned\u00a0order to stop production and sale of Maggi was passed.\n\"FSSAI was not against Nestle India or on inimical terms\u00a0with it. We are ready to give it a hearing. If it complies\u00a0with the conditions in law, we have no objection to the\u00a0company producing and selling Maggi in Indian market,\" Singh\u00a0said.\nThe arguments would continue tomorrow.\u00a0Nestle has argued that a certain batch of Maggi may have\u00a0contained lead beyond permissible limit but the decision to\u00a0impose a blanket ban was \"unfair and illegal.\"\nThe company has claimed that it had tested the product in\u00a02,700 laboratories in India and also abroad and the tests\u00a0indicated that the lead content was less than the permissible\u00a0limit of 0.5 percent.\n", "title": "FSSAI justifies Maggi ban; says will give hearing to Nestle", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/currentaffairs/fssai-justifies-maggi-ban-says-will-give-hearing-to-nestle_2121181.html", "time": "8.34 pm "}, {"date": " 23 Jul 2015", "content": "Jul 24, 2015, 08.17 AM  | Source: IBNLive.com\nBombay HC on Maggi ban: Why no showcause notice issued?\nIn a boost to Nestle India, the Bombay High on Thursday questioned the blanket ban on Maggi 2-minute noodles.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nBombay HC on Maggi ban: Why no showcause notice issued?\nIn a boost to Nestle India, the Bombay High on Thursday questioned the blanket ban on Maggi 2-minute noodles.\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nIn a boost to Nestle India , the Bombay High on Thursday questioned the blanket ban on Maggi 2-minute noodles.\nThe Court asked the government why the entire product was banned if just one batch was found to be bad.

Here's one way to invest it\nWeak rainfall can potentially impact the FMCG sector in two ways: by raising input prices and thus impacting margins or by impacting the spending power of the rural economy (which is a key constituent of sales for the sector, and is, to some extent, agrarian).\nBut analysts at the firm dug into data from the past 15 years to look at the potential impact of disruptive weather patterns on consumer demand as well as input prices.\nThe study found out that monsoons were significantly deficient in six years since FY98 but sales growth for the sector followed a largely secular trend, falling about 15 percent levels in 1998, falling to about 0 percent growth in 2002-03, and then coming back up to 15 percent levels since (while falling off slightly in 2013).\n\u201cWe observe that rainfall and FMCG sector growth only have a correlation of about 20 percent,\u201d the report says.\nThe correlation between agriculture growth and FMCG sector growth is also weak \u2013 only 26 percent, it finds. \u201cThere have been large variations in agricultural sector growth over the past 15 years -- largely on account of rainfall. But this volatility has not had as much of an impact on FMCG sector growth largely because of the nature of the products.\u201d\nIf the monsoon season is poor, input prices could see an upward bias. \"Recent comments by Nestle , at its analysts meet, suggest a significant increase in milk, wheat and green coffee prices. If the monsoon is poor, and crops are impacted, we could see a spike in other input costs as well,\" the report says.\nBut it sees limited impact to margins in case of a moderate price rise because of FMCG companies\u2019 ability to pass on cost increases to consumers.\nValuations\nAccording to the report, valuations for the FMCG sector (29.3 times forward earnings) are trading above the five-year average of 27.6 times but well below last year\u2019s peak of 35.5 times.\nNomura\u2019s top picks in the sector are\u00a0 ITC and\u00a0 Godrej Consumer Products while it believes valuations are stretched in the case of\u00a0 Hindustan Unilever and Colgate .\nITC stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:51 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 319.05, down Rs 1.4, or 0.44 percent.
