Malhotra, a deputy managing director at the State Bank of India , the country's largest bank, said his team received extra training, including in psychology, and was systematically chasing up payments, as others in the bank accelerated sales of seized assets.\n\"The focus (is) on getting court cases expedited. Less on the paperwork and more on the fieldwork,\" said Malhotra.\nExecutives say it's too early to measure overall success, but there have been some wins for India's bruised banks.\nSuzlon Energy this year sold its German unit, Senvion, for 1 billion euros (USD 1.1 billion) in cash - less than what it paid to buy the asset in a deal completed in 2011. It crystallised a huge loss after banks piled pressure on the loss-making wind-turbine maker to cut its debt.\nMore than two dozen lenders led by SBI are looking for an investor in Electrosteel Steels Ltd , whose near-USD 1.4 billion bank loan is strained. Rather than 'evergreening' the loan - a process of regular review and renew - lenders are getting involved in the buyer talks, an individual with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nEARLY WARNINGS\nGross bad loans at Indian banks rose to 3.1 trillion rupees (USD 48.83 billion) as of end-March, or 4.6 percent of total loans, according to central bank data. Including loans that are stressed but not yet classified as bad, total troubled loans made up 11 percent of total lending.\nBanks say they are now moving faster to bring that down, stepping in at the first sign of trouble, sending out more officers to chase borrowers and putting more people on the job through specialised branches. Some are trying to speed up the sale of seized assets by advertising them on large screens at shopping malls.\n\"These days people are getting on to the job the moment you have an early warning signal that something may happen in a company and you have thousands of crores at stake,\" said a senior banker at a big state-run bank. India uses crore to denote a unit of 10 million.\nSBI has set up branches focussed solely on recovering loans, and, to speed up cumbersome paperwork, encourages managers to snap pictures of themselves on seized assets - proof of the change of ownership. It plans to set up a web portal to showcase all the seized assets available for auction.\n\"Companies can sometimes fall in love with their assets, but bankers can't afford to do that,\" said SBI's Malhotra.\nUnion Bank of India Chairman Arun Tiwari said his state-run lender has changed its system to put three separate general managers in charge of recovering different classes of loans - large, middle and small.\n\"You have to go out in the field,\" he said.\nSBI stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  11:59 hrs State Bank of India was quoting at Rs 230.10, down Rs 0.9, or 0.39 percent.

Suzlon has aggressively reduced debt from its heavily levered balance sheet by divesting its German subsidiary Senvion (for Euro 1 billion) and via a preferential issue of Rs 1,800 crore to Dilip Shanghvi and Associates (DSA).\n\"These developments will enable the company to not only reduce debt but also provide much needed working capital to ramp up business in the rapidly growing Indian wind energy market,\" said HDFC Securities in its note.\nWith the NDA government\u2019s ambitious plans for renewable energy, the brokerage expects favourable policy environment for wind power to continue, adding it is among a handful of listed companies levered to India\u2019s fast growing renewables industry.\nThe Indian wind energy market is set for a big leap as accelerated depreciation (AD) and generation based incentives (GBI) have been re-introduced. The NDA government has ambitious plans of adding 38GW over FY15-22.\nSuzlon has the best overall product offering and it lost market share primarily owing to funding constraints.\nAided by significant operating and financial leverage, HDFC Securities expects Suzlon\u2019s earnings to grow manifold over the next few years.\n\"As 25 percent of Suzlon\u2019s expenses are fixed in nature (FY16E), we expect a quantum jump in profits as volumes ramp up. We expect Suzlon to achieve profit before tax break-even in FY16E (1,250MW of sales, 150 percent increase over FY15E), which implies 35 percent market share. This looks plausible, given the company\u2019s order book of 1,147MW.

Even if we see the numbers, there is nothing to upset long-term investors and given the fact that the government is now working so hard on the last mile connectivity with the people with the payment mechanism, the potential continues to be very strong for SKS to grow it's book and all its securitisation has been at very good rates. The kind of mess up that we have had has already kind of exercised of sorts, there is nothing pending in terms of litigation against the company.\nMy sense is any fresh borrowing could improve ROEs dramatically, that means the stock is undervalued as compared to a lot of these non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). So it went up, it has come down, so these are stocks, which quietly again rise up. At these levels\nnot only it is likely to play catch up but the growth is also going to be end of compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least about 30-35 percent. So I don\u2019t think we should miss out on that.\nSuzlon Energy & Pipavav Defence\nI would touch Suzlon Energy \u00a0and Pipavav Defence . Disclosure is, I have exposure to Suzlon at least. Very clearly it is a company that could breathe into. The best part is the positivity around it; everybody is going to support it. State Bank of India \u00a0(SBI) gets Rs 6000 crore off and that itself is big. The day results were announced, people thought it were\ngreat numbers that SBI went up 6 percent but it was also on the back of this news that Rs 6000 crore is going to released from the Suzlon debt. So, these are very positive things.\nIt makes a lot of sense for anybody who has got capital to revive this business because it is one of the best placed businesses given the government\u2019s focus on reviving them. The rest all plays put together might not add up to the capacity that Suzlon has on the wind energy\nside. So, it is great news but the dynamics and the open offer will take time to settle down. According to me Rs 18 is just the start; I don\u2019t see revisions come up.\nIt is the same story with Pipavav Defence. It is one of the most established businesses. It would take about 4-5 years to set that kind of a base up. So, a group like Mahindra and Mahindra \u00a0which has always been very focused onto defence has to get into it and at some stage will find it cheap to grow inorganically rather than spend too much of time. So, they have the capabilities to scale up which SKIL is struggling with for whatever reasons. So, it is a great combination out there as well.\nCement\nAll large cement players are offering a very good opportunity for some sort of a re-rating except people have issues with valuation in some of them. If I were to pay top dollar I would still go with UltraTech Cement .\nIf I had to stick my neck out in the high premium it would still be UltraTech because of the kind of footprint that it has developed. So, Ambuja Cements \u00a0and ACC \u00a0put together might be able to counter UltraTech. It has got great strength but the smaller ones are where the\npromise lies, where your EV/EBITDA per tonne is much more scalacble in terms of profit. Mangalam Cement \u00a0disappointed, my favourite is Prism Cement . The domesticfication is so perfect, everything is in place and it is backed by a developer group. So there is always captive business on that side.\n", "title": "Here are Prakash Diwan's top trading ideas", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/marketoutlook/hereprakash-diwans-top-trading-ideas_1306489.html", "time": "9.25 am "}, {"date": " 18 Feb 2015", "content": "Feb 18, 2015, 09.01 AM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nEmerging India Focus sells 2.72 cr shares of Suzlon Energy\nOn February 16, 2015 Emerging India Focus Fund - FCCB sold 2,72,68,752 shares of Suzlon Energy.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nEmerging India Focus sells 2.72 cr shares of Suzlon Energy\nOn February 16, 2015 Emerging India Focus Fund - FCCB sold 2,72,68,752 shares of Suzlon Energy.\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nOn February 16, 2015 Emerging India Focus Fund - FCCB sold 2,72,68,752 shares of Suzlon Energy at Rs 22.34 on the NSE.\nOn Monday,\u00a0 Suzlon Energy ended at Rs 22.95, up Rs 3.80, or 19.84 percent.\nThe share touched its 52-week high Rs 36.80 and 52-week low Rs 10.32 on 12 June, 2014 and 27 March, 2014, respectively.\nThe latest book value of the company is Rs 8.37 per share.

What is driving the stock is a deal with\u00a0 Sun Pharmaceutical founder Dilip Shanghvi.\nShanghvi has agreed to buy a 23 percent stake in Indian wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy for about USD 290 million.\nThe India's second-richest man will pay Rs 1800 crore through Dilip Shanghvi Family and Associates (DSA) for 1 billion new shares in Suzlon, issued by way of a preferential allotment. Shanghvi's investment firm and Suzlon will also form a wind farm joint venture for the development of 450 megawatt (MW) of wind farms, a company statement said.\nLoss-making Suzlon has been under pressure over the last few years due to a slowdown in global turbine sales and a growing debt pile. It was forced to restructure USD 1.8 billion of debt after defaulting on a USD 200 million convertible bond redemption in 2012.\nThe deal will provide Suzlon with much needed liquidity and the company said it would also use the cash to tap opportunities in India and growth markets like the United States, China, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and Mexico.\nMeanwhile, the debt-laden wind turbine maker reported a widening of consolidated net loss at Rs 6,538.68 crore for the third quarter ended December 2014 on the back of sale of its overseas subsidiary Senvion.\nIts total income declined marginally to Rs 4,977.18 crore during the October-December quarter as against Rs 5,052.2 crore in the third quarter of FY14. Last month, the company had sold Senvion to Centrebridge Partners LP for Rs 7,200 crore as part of its strategy to hive off non-core businesses and reduce debt burden of over Rs 17,000 crore.\nAt 09:38 hrs Suzlon Energy was at Rs 21.75, up Rs 2.60, or 13.58 percent on the BSE.\n(With inputs from agencies)\n", "title": "Suzlon shrugs off weak Q3, climbs 18% on deal with Shanghvi", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzingstocks/suzlon-shrugs-off-weak-q3-climbs-18dealshanghvi_1304089.html", "time": "9.54 am "}, {"date": " 16 Feb 2015", "content": "Feb 16, 2015, 09.00 AM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nHere are top 10 stocks to keep an eye on February 16\nHere are top 10 stocks to keep an eye on February 16 - Union Bank, BPCL, ONGC, Oil India, Hindalco, Suzlon, Sun Pharma, SBI, Bhushan Steel and Eicher Motor.

Its total income declined marginally to Rs 4,977.18 crore during the October-December quarter as against Rs 5,052.2 crore in the third quarter of FY14.\n\"The huge loss during the quarter is on account of the notional loss to the extent of around Rs 6,000 crore on the sale of our overseas subsidiary Senvion last month,\" the company's Chairman Tulsi Tanti told PTI here today. Last month, the company had sold Senvion to Centrebridge Partners LP for Rs 7,200 crore as part of its strategy to hive off non-core businesses and reduce debt burden of over Rs 17,000 crore.\n\"Most of the proceeds of this deal will be used to pay off our debt. Besides, we are also looking at selling stake in SE Forge, another non-core business,\" he said. However, he did not disclose further details on how much the company is expecting from the sale of subsidiary. \"It is too premature to talk about this.\nBut we will be using the funds raised through the sale for repaying our debt,\" Tanti said. The company has also sold stake in its manufacturing capacity in China as well as in US-based Big Sky wind farm. Meanwhile, the company has also signed definitive agreements with Dilip Shanghvi Family and Associates (DSA) for equity investments of Rs 1,800 crore in Suzlon Energy.\nPost allotment, DSA shareholding will be 23 per cent shares (based on current shareholding), while the Tanti Family will hold 24 per cent shares. Management control will remain with Tanti family by virtue of pooling arrangement for voting. \"All the strategic initiatives are extremely crucial and will pave the way for our growth.\nThese bold steps will strengthen our capital structure permanently, enabling significant de-leveraging and liquidity to ramp up volumes rapidly,\" he said. The proceeds of both the transactions are expected to be received before March 31, he added. Both Suzlon and Sanghvi will form a joint venture to develop 450 MW with farm, a move that will mark the latter's foray into the renewable energy business.\nBesides, the Sanghvi Family and Associates will provide project specific non-fund capital for two years, which will be utilised for execution and capacity utilisation, Tanti said.\n", "title": "Suzlon's Q3 net loss widens to Rs 6,538.68

So, I think over the next two years, all these large projects which are mineral based will get sorted out.\nPost your opinion here\nExcerpts from India Business Hour on CNBC-TV18 Watch the full show \u00c2\u0165\nThe new Narendra Modi government is doing a lot to make it easier to do business in the country. But it has miles to go before India's ranking in this area improves significantly. That's the word from captains of Indian industry including Sajjan Jindal, Dilip Shanghvi and Tulsi Tanti, who together command a market capitalisation of nearly Rs 5 lakh crore.\nHowever, speaking at a conference on how to build a new India organised by Antique, these captains agreed that the government's efforts would not amount to much unless corporate India pitched in.\nHere's a list of areas the industry bigwigs believe have seen some progress, and some areas where a lot still needs to be done.\nSajjan Jindal, Chairman & MD, JSW Steel \u00a0- On govt boosting industry confidence\nProp up the confidence level that we are with you, we want to support you, we want industry, we want manufacturing and that is what this government has done - whether it is the Prime Minister or his colleagues - they are giving this confidence back to the investor community and that is the first very important step.\nIn the UPA-II where we suffered, there was no clarity of thought whether the government wanted projects to happen. One wing or one arm was saying we have to move forward and the other one was saying no we have to go back.\nThis government is putting all these things into order. Similarly on the ordinances that they issued on iron-ore and mining minerals, it has become very clear that now it will be through the auction route, through a transparent route. So, I think over the next two years my belief is that all these large projects which are mineral based will get sorted out.\nAshwin Dani, VC & MD, Asian Paints \u00a0- On demand on the ground\nSignals are very clear that on the ground demand is yet to pick up and until the demand really picks up I think the consumer industry is still not feeling the positive vibes that we see in the environment.\nDilip Shanghvi, Founder, Sun Pharma \u00a0- On employable and skilled youth\nWe see that availability of graduates from college who are employable is limited. So, typically most of the people that we hire they go through an extensive training programme .So, I think the important focus before we can become a supplier of products globally is to look at education and create capacity in our education system to generate employable youth.\nOn the other side, you have industry problem of not getting enough people of the skill that they require. We have to find a way to bridge this because manufacturing unlike services require specific skills and capability for us to succeed and to be able to compete globally. The other issue is the issue of innovation for our business. Philosophically, as a country we have never given premium for original thinking. It is easier to copy, safer to copy because you have less risk of failure.\nSajjan Jindal, Chairman & MD, JSW Steel - On dumping\nWe don't have very quick redressal system on dumping. So when, for example lets take an example of Russia and Ukraine where their currencies have crashed by nearly 100 percent they have become double of what it used to be. Demand within Russia and Ukraine has collapsed. So, they are now dumping steel into India. Our government does not have a very quick mechanism or even the industry is not prepared to apply to the government to take a very quick action on this redressal to bring in countervailing duties or bringing in anti-dumping or safeguard duties. So, now the industry is working together to create this concept. We are already in discussion with the government.\nDilip Shanghvi, Founder, Sun Pharma - On R&D\nI think there are lot of bureaucratic restrictions in research. So, for doing animal experiments, for import of large animals, for doing lets say phase 1, phase 2 studies, human studies, lets say when you are doing clinical trial for cancer drug. So there would be some deaths in clinical trial possibly because of the drug, the number of deaths would be lower than it would have been otherwise if they were not treated. However, the regulatory process that is now in place for any company to do clinical trial in India and the kind of responsibility on the sponsor for any kind of potential - say like normally in India you can't do a placebo control study. Globally you can do placebo control study. So, large number of unrealistic restrictions prevent the industry to be able to invest in research.\nTulsi Tanti, Chairman & MD, Suzlon Group - On policy initiative and target versus momentum\nTwo, three policy initiatives already government has taken which has accelerated investment into the industry. However, when we see the size of the target versus the momentum it is not good enough.\n200 gigawatt target and even countries future requirement, 30 percent energy we have home resources \u2013 green and solar.

billion in the offshore segment. From FY16 onwards revenue of 2 billion euro per megawatt is likely to start flowing into the company\u2019s books.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nOffshore wind mkt next key trigger for debt-ridden Suzlon?\nSuzlon\u2018s Finance Group Head, Kirti Vagadia said that the company has order backlog of worth USD 1.2 billion in the offshore segment. From FY16 onwards revenue of 2 billion euro per megawatt is likely to start flowing into the company\u2019s books.\nPost your opinion here\nHarsha Jethmalani\nmoneycontrol.com\nSuzlon Energy \u00a0is betting big on the offshore wind market with its German subsidiary Senvion Systems SE. The company is confident of tapping this market especially in Europe via Senvioin, which produces 6.15MW turbine and is the third-biggest supplier of offshore turbines.\nWind farms which are constructed in water bodies to generate electricity from wind are known as offshore wind power. Suzlon is present in the offshore segment since 2004 and has 100 offshore turbines with more than 600MW installed. The company supplies turbines to its offshore customers while other infrastructure facilities have to be created by the latter.\nSuzlon\u2018s Finance Group Head, Kirti Vagadia said that the company has order backlog of worth USD 1.2 billion in the offshore segment. \u201cWhen compared to the onshore, the plant load factor (PLF) and costs for offshore are double, but this option is commercially viable. Also, this market has huge untapped potential and as of now there are only few players in offshore. We expect to benefit from our early entry in this segment,\u201d he said in a recent interaction with the press. The offshore market is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 31 percent between 2011 and 2016.\nIn the current fiscal year (FY15) the company is likely to execute only a small part of the offshore orders, but from FY16 onwards revenue of 2 billion euro per megawatt is likely to start flowing into the company\u2019s books, he said.\nLight at end of tunnel\nOnce the darling of investors, Suzlon Energy\u2019s fall from grace was equally swift. The company came out with an IPO at Rs 510 per share (Rs 10 paid up)\u00a0 in October 2005, and went on to hit a record high of Rs 2185 by January 2008. But the stock has been on a downward spiral since then and is currently ruling at Rs 21 a share. When compared with Sensex returns, the stock has tanked 77 percent while the benchmark has gained 68 percent in the last five years. The reason for this sharp fall is a combination of internal and external factors.\nThe company defaulted on USD 221 million worth of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), India\u2019s biggest convertible-bond default, maturing on October 11, 2012, after it failed to get an extension from bondholders. This caused huge stress on its financials with the company posting losses since FY10 and attracting huge debt. Global slowdown, high interest cost and removal of tax concessions for wind power in India added to the pain.\nBut, the wind turbine maker is now gearing up for a turnaround and is on a debt reduction spree. It aims to repay Rs 8,000 crore in FY15. Its Q1FY15 losses narrowed to Rs 750.74 crore from Rs 1,058.90 crore in the same period a year ago, mainly on the back of higher income. In the last one year, the stock has risen 239 percent while Sensex has gained 43 percent.\nReiterating that FY15 will be a turnaround year for the company , Vagaria said that the company\u2019s debt in terms of rupee is likely to be at Rs 1,000 crore by March next year. \u201cThere was repayment pressure due to defaulting on FCCBs, but now the situation has improved and the debt overhang from Suzlon will be removed,\u201d he added.\nSuzlon has already completed operational restructuring and is currently working on capital restructuring. \u201cWe target to complete capital restructuring in this financial year. We have liabilities worth Rs 9,000 crore. We would be transferring Rs 4,000 crore high cost rupee debt to euro debt and would be raising a similar sum of amount from the European equity market via Senvion as well,\u201d he added.\nFurther, sale of non-core assets program is on track and the company has already sold non-core assets worth Rs 700 crore, he said. Within a time frame of nine-12 months, Suzlon is looking to offload non-core assets like component manufacturing units, old manufacturing units, which fetch good realty value and office complexes. The company has more than 25 old manufacturing units at multiple locations.\nThe policy push\nSuzlon also aims to cash-in on the slew of measures that were announced in PM Narendra Modi\u2019s maiden Budget in July. According to Vagaria, re-introduction of accelerated depreciation (AD) has bought back SME and captive demand. Secondly, generation based incentives (GBIs) which provide Rs.0.50/unit incentive to generators with a cap of Rs 1 crore/MW, up from Rs 0.62 crore/MW, and will lead to setting up of new capacities by IPPs. GBI was withdrawn in March 2012, reintroduced in March 2013 and notified in September 2013. Though Vagaria sees some teething issues but is hopeful of the system coming on track.\nThe National Green Energy Fund for which the cess has been doubled to Rs 100/mt is also a big positive for the sector, he added. Also, fast tracking of implementation of Green Corridor, removal of 4 percent SAD for WTG manufacturing and making 2% CSR in renewable energy mandatory are the other key triggers for Suzlon\u2019s growth going ahead, he said.\nDisclaimer: The correspondent's trip to Bhuj was organised by Suzlon Energy Ltd\nSuzlon Energy stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  12:14 hrs Suzlon Energy was quoting at Rs 21.35, up Rs 0.20, or 0.95 percent.

Its net loss for the quarter ended 31 March narrowed to Rs 603.45 crore from Rs 1,912.72 crore in the year-ago period, helped by cost reductions and restructuring of operations.\nVagadia says the company will turn PAT-positive if it achieves revenue of Rs 7,000-7,500 crore on a quarterly basis.

For the current fiscal, the company would mainly focus on ramping up volumes, boosting business efficiency and optimising capital structure.\n\u201cWe expect a growth of 40 percent in both global and indian markets,\u201d he told CNBC-TV18\u2019s Sonia Shenoy and Latha Venkatesh.\nBelow is verbatim transcript of the interview on CNBC-TV18\nLatha: There is a swing at the earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) level. When does the swing happen at the net level? And when do you turn black at a net profit level?\nA: It was our priority to deliver the operational profit in Q4 of last year. Our increase in revenue, favorable market and product mix has been a key factor behind delivering this operational profit. However, our quarterly interest cost in case of net profit at profit after tax (PAT) level is about Rs 430 crore. For delivering quarterly profitability at net level, we need Rs 1200-1500 crore more of revenue i.e. about Rs 7000-7500 crore of revenue can generate us a net profit level.\nSonia: Do you think that this Rs 7500 crore revenue figure could be achieved in FY15? What is the order book visibility for FY15?\nA: We have a strong order backlog at Rs 46000 crore and is thus, not an issue for us. Ramping up our volume is our priority for FY15.\nLatha: Is Rs 7500 crore your FY15 target?\nA: It is the quarterly revenue target.\nLatha: Do you see it happening in this year?\nA: We have attempted for it to happen in this year.\nSonia: What does the Senvion performance look like in Q4? Also, what kind of trajectory would you expect for FY15?\nA: I would not prefer to go for any of our subsidiaries on a quarterly basis. However, in context to the annual profitability, Senvion has delivered revenue of about EUR 1.8 billion-- 8 percent of the revenue, and EBITA of 145 million\u2014 about 5.5 percent in FY14.\nSo far, since our acquisition of Senvion in 2007, it has remained in a profitable growth mode. While the last three years were bad for the industry, Senvion has continued to make profit. The most remarkable factor about Senvion\u2019s performance is that it gave a 25 percent increase in EBITA despite the 20 percent decline in revenue last year; indicating that we\u00a0 have delivered only profitable orders.\nLatha: Are you considering re-listing Senvion? If yes, on which bourse ?\nA: Though re-listing Senvion is of the options that we may explore, optimizing our capital structure is one of our key priorities in FY15 and is also one of our options.\nLatha: Would it be the entire company or a part of it? Will it be in the London Stock Exchange or here in India?\nA: We will only be able to discuss such details once we have finalized our plans. I just wanted to highlight the improved valuation of wind OEM. European wind OEMs are trading slightly at 10 multiple of EBITA and is therefore, an attractive option.\n", "title": "Suzlon eyes growth of 40% in both global & Indian markets", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/resultsboardroom/suzlon-eyes-growth40both-globalindian-markets_1096802.html", "time": "11.13 am "}, {"date": " 01 Jun 2014", "content": "Jun 02, 2014, 08.47 AM  | Source: PTI\nSuzlon to raise Rs 1K cr from non-core asset sales in FY15\nSuzlon realised about Rs 550 crore from the sale of US-based Big Sky wind farm and around Rs 173 crore by offloading stake in a Chinese manufacturing facility.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nSuzlon to raise Rs 1K cr from non-core asset sales in FY15\nSuzlon realised about Rs 550 crore from the sale of US-based Big Sky wind farm and around Rs 173 crore by offloading stake in a Chinese manufacturing facility.\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nWind turbine maker Suzlon Energy , which is working on its business revival strategy, plans to raise about Rs 1,000 crore from sale of non-core assets this financial year.\nBesides, Suzlon is exploring new markets for business opportunities, according to a top company official.\n\"We continue to work on selling non-core assets.

Initially, for first 18 months, it is lower rate and then it is stepping up. Overall basis, it is closer to 5 percent, which is RBI\u2019s ceiling on the annual credit plan (ACP).\nLatha: What are the other terms of the bond; it is a USD 458 million FCCB issue?\nA: Yes. It takes care of my all four outstanding series of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) and the principle amount is around USD 484 million. It is about 10 percent premium on SEBI floor price of shares and it is a five year bond. So maturity would be roughly in July 2019.\nSonia: When do you expect to get the necessary approvals from the regulators on this particular FCCB?\nA: Regulatory approval is something, which is always in the hands of regulator. But we have budgeted certain period. We expect all regulatory approvals by middle of June. We will be having a bondholder\u2019s formal meeting on July 9.\nLatha: What is your current outflow of interest for FY15, counting both the foreign outflows, the dollar outflows as well as the rupee outflows?\nA: As you are aware that some of our interest, which is on term loan is getting converted into equity, so it is not a cash outflow. So if you take total interest burden on the company on an annual basis it is roughly about Rs 1300-1400 crore. But if you take cash outflow on interest it is less than Rs 500 crore.\nSonia: So how much of your non-core assets you would be able to sell in this financial year in order to repay your debt?\nA: We have sold our China asset as well as our US asset, which is Edison Mission. We are further targeting to sell roughly about Rs 1000 crore from non-core asset. This Rs 1000 crore will be sold within FY15 itself that is our target.\nLatha: So what is the debt now and what will it come down to, what is the timetable you are looking at?\nA: If you take the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) it is roughly about Rs 9000 crore and over and above that is foreign currency debt of roughly about a billion dollars.\nSonia: When do you think Suzlon could manage to breakeven with this bond agreement also in place do you think there could be a breakeven within FY15 or do you think it would be in FY16?\nA: First let me brief you that this is a difficult period which I believe is over for us. Market is moving towards a growth phase so we have well within time restructured our organization. Now we are looking at about global and domestic market growth growing at a 40 percent rate as compared to last financial year. And you might be aware that despite all difficult period Suzlon has been able to maintain its global position at number five in this year as well. With all the stake holders supporting particularly our lenders, customers, suppliers, we are in a position to quickly go back to a volume growth. I don't want to give any target, but definitely in this particular financial year, we will try to achieve a quarterly breakeven as quickly as possible.\nPragya: So currently the FCCBs, which are outstanding on the company, is only USD 485 million, which the company has been able to restructure?\nA: That is correct.\nPragya: The other question is with regards to the listing of REpower. The company has made a lot of comments on that. There is a lot of market speculation. Could you give us a roadmap as to what is the company targeting on that front? Will we see something in this financial year given that REpower\u2019s order inflows etc, has been fairly strong in the current global conditions or we will have to wait for some announcements on that?\nA: First let me say that REpower is one of the strongest assets in the wind energy. It has been generating significant growth and profit even in the worst financial years of wind industry. As compared to peer group it has maintained its profitability in last three years which was not good for wind industry.\nSo it is a very strong asset and as you are aware that financial market is very favourable for wind energy particularly debt and equity is now available very easily for wind energy market, wind energy companies. Valuation which was previously around multiple of EBITDA at four times has gone closer to 9-10 in the global market. So definitely the valuation of our company has also improved significantly.\nSenvion is the new name of REpower. I would not say that we will opt only for a listing as an option but definitely this is one of the options, which we may explore at a suitable time because we need to rebalance our capital structure.\nLatha: Is that suitable time the current financial year?\nA: I cannot comment on the timing of this. It is a function of many factors. However, this is one of our options, which we may explore at a suitable time.\nSuzlon Energy stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  12:16 hrs Suzlon Energy was quoting at Rs 21.35, up Rs 0.20, or 0.95 percent.
