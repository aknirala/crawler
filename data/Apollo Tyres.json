Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.\nHemen Kapadia of KR Choksey Securities\nI have a sell call on Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). The stock has reflected near-term weakness by giving a downward bar reversal on the daily chart. Some of the mechanical indicators are supporting the move, have signaled a sell indicating the stock intention to depreciate further from here. One can sell IOC at its closing of around Rs 416, stoploss of Rs 420 and a target of Rs 408.\nI have a sell call on HDFC Bank . The stock is in a short-term downtrend. It is quoting below the 55-day moving average. The mechanical indicators have signaled a sell indicating the stocks intention to depreciate further from here. One can sell HDFC Bank at its closing of around Rs 1,046, stoploss of Rs 1,054 and a target of Rs 1,028.8\nGaurav Bissa of LKP Securities\nMy first recommendation today is a buy on Voltas . The stock was one of the very few who managed to close with some amount of gains and with positivity. The technical indicators are also favoring further upside in the stock. I recommend going long in this stock. One can have a stoploss Rs 290 and play for targets of Rs 320.\nMy second recommendation today would be a sell call on Apollo Tyres . The stock has seen fresh shorts happening, it started witnessing long unwinding, fresh shorts, it is a very dangerous combination. Going ahead we expect significant downside coming in the stock. I would recommend going short in the stock for the target price of Rs 135. One can have a small stoploss at Rs 153.\nKunal Saraogi of Equityrush\nMy first stock call for the day will be a sell on Union Bank of India . I think government banks have broken major supports. One can short Union Bank with a target of Rs 138 and with a stoploss at Rs 148.\nMy second stock call will be a sell on Larsen and Toubro (L&T) which has been weak for the last so many days and it has got go down more. It can be sold with first target of Rs 1,250. One should put a stoploss at Rs 1,300.\n", "title": "Super Six short term picks for December 14", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocksviews/super-six-short-term-picks-for-december-14_4562381.html", "time": "8.52 am "}, {"date": " 18 Nov 2015", "content": "Nov 18, 2015, 11.28 AM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nSuper Six short term picks for November 18\nGaurav Bissa of LKP Securities is of the view that one may buy Oil and Natural Gas Corporation with a target of Rs 240.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nSuper Six short term picks for November 18\nGaurav Bissa of LKP Securities is of the view that one may buy Oil and Natural Gas Corporation with a target of Rs 240.\nPost your opinion here\n08:00 am\nOn CNBC-TV18's show Super Six, market gurus Rajat Bose, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi and Gaurav Bissa, place their bets on two stocks each, thus offering investors a variety of options to choose from. Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.\nRajat Bose of rajatkbose.com\nThe first stock that I would like to recommend is Vedanta . Yesterday, it performed very well with a lot of volume activity, closed around Rs 92. This stock is headed for higher levels, at least I am expecting Rs 94.20 which is my first target and the next target is Rs 95.80, put a stoploss below Rs 90.\nSecond stock which I am going to recommend is Apollo Tyres . Yesterday, Tyre stocks did well and Apollo Tyres is recovering from a lower level of completing its downside correction. It is headed for levels of Rs 165-166 which is my target range for the day and put a stop loss below Rs 160.\nGaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan\nI have a buy call on Bharti Infratel . The stock has formed a short-term correction in last few weeks. In terms of Fibonacci retracement, it has retraced nearly 78.6 percent of the previous rise which was an impulse on the upside. And to end the correction, the stock has formed an ending diagonal pattern on the daily chart and has broken out on the upside in the last session. So, I have a buy call on Bharti Infratel with stoploss of Rs 376 and target will be Rs 410.\nI have a buy call on India Cements . The stock has been consolidating near its crucial weekly moving averages for the last few weeks. The consolidation has taken form of a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. The pattern is on the verge of a breakout on the upside. So, the stock has decent upside potential from current level and from trading perspective, stop loss can be placed at Rs 79-50 and the target will be Rs 88.80.\nGaurav Bissa of LKP Securities\nMy first recommendation today is a buy call on Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). The stock after witnessing decent amount of corrections seems to be forming short-term base formation around Rs 225-227 kind of levels. I recommend going long for a target price of Rs 240 keeping the stop loss at Rs 227.\nMy second recommendation today is a sell call on Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL). The stock has seen consistent long unwinding. Fresh shorts yet to be seen, but then again, the fact that the long unwinding from the levels of Rs 795-800 are seen, indicates that the Rs 795-800 would act as a strong resistance for this stock going ahead. I recommend going short on HPCL for targets of Rs 740 keeping a stoploss at Rs 790.\n", "title": "Super Six short term picks for November 18", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocksviews/super-six-short-term-picks-for-november-18_4208721.html", "time": "10.09 am "}, {"date": " 17 Nov 2015", "content": "Nov 17, 2015, 02.05 PM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nApollo Tyres extends gains on acquisition of German company\nThe company's one of the promoters - Sunrays Properties & Investment Company has released pledge on its 33.82 lakh shares on November 10.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nApollo Tyres extends gains on acquisition of German company\nThe company's one of the promoters - Sunrays Properties & Investment Company has released pledge on its 33.82 lakh shares on November 10.\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nMoneycontrol Bureau\nShares of Apollo Tyres gained another\u00a03.2 percent intraday Tuesday, in addition to 1.7 percent upside in previous session after acquisition of Germany-based tyre company.\nOn Monday, it said wholly owned subsidiary would acquire Reifencom GmbH for 45.6 million euro in all cash deal and this deal is likely to be completed in 1-3 months.\nReifencom has turnover of 147 million euro in 2014 and has presence in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France & Denmark.\nAdditionally, Sunrays Properties & Investment Company, one\u00a0of the company's promoters,\u00a0has released pledge on its 33.82 lakh shares on November 10.\nSunrays has 7.02 percent (3.57 crore shares) shareholding in the company as of today, out of which 2.35 percent (1.19 crore shares) stake has been pledged with Bajaj Finance after release of shares.\nAt 13:40 hours IST, the scrip of Apollo Tyres was quoting at Rs 161.50, up Rs 3.80, or 2.41 percent on the BSE.\nPosted by Sunil Shankar Matkar\n", "title": "Apollo Tyres extends gains on acquisition of German company", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzingstocks/apollo-tyres-extends-gainsacquisitiongerman-company_4193161.html", "time": "2.05 pm "}], [{"date": " 16 Nov 2015", "content": "Nov 16, 2015, 09.48 PM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nApollo Tyres: Outcome of board meeting\nApollo Tyres in its meeting held on November 16, 2015, have transacted the business approved the shorter notice of the Meeting.

That plant will begin production in 2017.\n\"Once Hungary comes on stream we will have much more cost competitiveness to sell in the US We would begin with hiring a small team... and grow from there,\" he said, adding that the company is still studying how big the team will be.\nKumar said the company also hopes to supply to carmakers in Europe such as Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and Suzuki Motor Corp that build cars close to its upcoming plant in Hungary.\nThe company will next year start raising, in tranches, up to USD 250 million of debt towards its planned USD 400 million investment in India.\nWith the Indian government working to kickstart stalled road infrastructure projects, Apollo, which mainly manufactures tyres for trucks and buses, is planning to double capacity at its plant in Chennai in southern India.\nApollo, which aims to become one of the world's top 10 tyremakers in a few years, could set up a third plant in an ASEAN country if demand rises and revenues in the region more than double from less than USD 100 million now, said Kumar.\nApollo Tyres stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  12:25 hrs Apollo Tyres was quoting at Rs 152.50, down Rs 1, or 0.65 percent.

Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.\nSameet Chavan of Angel Broking\nI have a buy call on Coal India with a stoploss of Rs 341 and target of Rs 370. Recently this stock has seen massive price erosion from its recent peak of nearly Rs 20-25 percent. However, on Monday this stock found strong support around its low of Rs 332 and stock price gave a sharp recovery from those levels. However, combining last three days candles, it can be now termed as a morning star pattern. Thus looking at the overall chart structure we expect this stock to give a bounce towards Rs 370 in next few trading sessions.\nI have a long call on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for a target of Rs 2,680 and stoploss of Rs 2,510. Recently this stock gave a breakout from a triangle pattern around Rs 2,600 on closing basis. After giving a sharp move towards Rs 2,700-2,740 we have witnessed a decent correction from its recent highs in last three days. The stock has now taken a strong support around its breakout point as well as the daily 89 exponential moving average (EMA). Thus considering the overall weekly chart structure, we expect resumption of an uptrend. Hence we have a target of Rs 2,680 on TCS and stoploss can be kept at Rs 2,510\nKunal Bothra of LKP Securities\nI have a buy call on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone . Yesterday the stock managed to form double bottom in support of Rs 325. I believe from a short-term basis it is trading above its 50 day moving average and 200 day moving average which is a good enough support for the stock from short-term basis as well. However, from trading perspective I am looking at a target of Rs 356 on Adani Ports keeping a stoploss of Rs 338 on it.\nI have a buy call on Larsen and Toubro (L&T). If you look at the last one-and-a-half years of chart, L&T has been more or less in a rising channel pattern with a sideways movement more or less in a range of 250-300 points. I sense that the support for L&T is somewhere closer to Rs 1,575-1,580, couple of days back the stock took support from those levels and has seen good enough bounce back. I think keeping that as a stoploss for trade - Rs 1,575, trader could look at buying this stock especially on dips to Rs 1,600. I feel a target of Rs 1,660 to Rs 1,700 is possible on the stock given that it doesn't break the crucial level of Rs 1,575 over the next couple of days.\nHemen Kapadia of KRChoksey Securities\nI have a buy call on Apollo Tyres . It has reflected near term strength by giving an upward key reversal on daily charts with decent volumes. The mechanical indicators have turned positive on the intraday charts; have signalled a buy indicating the stock intention to appreciate further from here. One can buy Apollo Tyres at its closing of around Rs 173 with a stoploss of Rs 170 and a target of Rs 179.\nI have a buy call on Axis Bank . It is deeply oversold, has reflected positive divergence. The mechanical indicators on the intraday charts have turned positive; have signalled a buy indicating the stocks intention to appreciate further from here. One can buy Axis Bank at closing of around Rs 502 with a stoploss of Rs 498 and a target of Rs 510.\n", "title": "6 stocks likely to see lot of action today", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocksviews/6-stocks-likely-to-see-lotaction-today_2745461.html", "time": "9.00 am "}, {"date": " 12 Aug 2015", "content": "Aug 12, 2015, 07.32 PM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nApollo Tyres: Outcome of AGM (Clause 35A)\nApollo Tyres has informed that the 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company was held on August 11, 2015, under Clause 35A.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nApollo Tyres: Outcome of AGM (Clause 35A)\nApollo Tyres has informed that the 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company was held on August 11, 2015, under Clause 35A.\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nApollo Tyres Ltd has informed BSE that the 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company was held on August 11, 2015, under Clause 35A.Source : BSE\nTo read the full report click here\nSet email alert for\n", "title": "Apollo Tyres: Outcome of AGM (Clause 35A)", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/announcements/apollo-tyres-outcomeagm-(clause-35a)_2483261.html", "time": "7.32 pm "}, {"date": " 12 Aug 2015", "content": "Aug 12, 2015, 01.14 PM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nTop buzzing midcap stocks to trade on August 12\nHere are a few top buzzing midcap stocks picked by CNBC-TV18's analysts in trade today.

It is one of our favourites and has been a strong outperformer in 2014 and 2015. In the last two weeks, it has been a bit of a struggle for this counter. SRF has failed to gain ground above it's previous top of Rs 1,350 which has ignited selling pressure. In fact, we can see a topping out pattern taking place on the daily chart which is a cause of concern. It is the right time to short this counter because it can re-test the previous breakout levels which was seen in the month of June. So, sell July Futures for a target of Rs 1,160.\"\nApollo Tyres\n\"One can sell Apollo Tyres . The stock has recently given a trend below Rs 196 with a breakdown from a rising wedge pattern which is infact telling us that it can go back to Rs 170-175. The point is that in last week's trade, it had given a breakout after four months of consolidation but failed to sustain the top, infact it came down. In the process it fell below it's 200-day moving average there by terming the last breakout as a false one. So, selling pressure below Rs 190 could move the stock towards Rs 180-176,\" he said.\nCipla\n\" Cipla for the last week has been moving sideways. Not doing much, in fact consolidating at the top. This consolidation has taken shape of a flag pattern. Flags are generally considered to be continuously better in nature. So, I am expecting the stock to replicate the runup which it had seen in the month of June and early July. So, buy Cipla for a target of Rs 720,\" he added.\n", "title": "Here are Pritesh Mehta's top trading ideas", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/marketoutlook/herepritesh-mehtas-top-trading-ideas_2170241.html", "time": "2.44 pm "}, {"date": " 21 Jul 2015", "content": "Jul 21, 2015, 10.34 AM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nSuper Six stocks that can boost your portfolio on July 21\nSameet Chavan of Angel Broking advises buying Rural Electrification Corporation with a target of Rs 310.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nSuper Six stocks that can boost your portfolio on July 21\nSameet Chavan of Angel Broking advises buying Rural Electrification Corporation with a target of Rs 310.\nPost your opinion here\n08:00 am\nOn CNBC-TV18's show Super Six, market gurus Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Sameet Chavan and Ashish Chaturmohta, place their bets on two stocks each, thus offering investors a variety of options to choose from. Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.\nGaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan\nI have a buy call on Ashok Leyland . The stock has been trading in a broad range for the last several weeks. However, in the last session it has crossed all time\nhigh of Rs 76.95 and has gone into extension on the upside. The short-term momentum indicator is in line with the extension but the weekly momentum\nindicator has completed its correction cycle and has started new cycle on the upside from the equilibrium line. So the stock has significant upside potential from\ncurrent level and from trading perspective stoploss can be placed at Rs 75.50 and target will be Rs 83.\nL&T Finance Holdings has been rallying smartly in a channelised manner and within that channel the stock has formed a bullish triangular pattern and is on the verge of a breakout on the upside. On the lower side the stock has support near lower channel line. The daily momentum indicator has formed a bullish hook pattern. So all these observations suggests that this is a good opportunity to go long and stoploss from trading perspective will be Rs 71 and target will be Rs 77.\nSameet Chavan of Angel Broking\nThe first stock that we like is Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). The stock can be bought with a stoploss of Rs 279 and target would be Rs 310. After\nforming a strong means around weekly 89 exponential moving averages (EMA), this stock gave a breakout on Thursday from its steep resistance zone of Rs\n286-287 on closing basis. Since last two days it has been struggling to cross its steep resistance of Rs 296 which is daily 89 EMA. However, looking at the\noverall chart structure we expect this stock to surpass this hurdle and can move towards Rs 300-310 which is our target.\nWe are upbeat on Ashok Leyland and with a stoploss of Rs 75. This stock can be bought for a target of Rs 84. Since last three months this stock oscillated in a range of Rs 76.50 to Rs 64. Yesterday it gave a decisive breakout beyond this range on closing basis. This indicates that the stock is likely to resume its high degree of trend. Hence with a near term view we have a target of Rs 84 and stoploss can be kept at Rs 75.\u00a0\nAshish Chaturmohta of Fortune Group\nWe are witnessing strong activity in the tyre stocks and in that space Apollo Tyres is looking positive. The stock after consolidating for last five months has given\na major breakout on the monthly charts above Rs 194 odd levels. We have also seen a strong activity in terms of volume as well as open interest in the entire\nspace. One can initiate a long position in Apollo Tyres keeping a stoploss below Rs 189 and on upside can expect a target of Rs 205-206 in next two-three\ntrading sessions.\nAshok Leyland has given a breakout towards all time high yesterday and this breakout has come after consolidation of last five months near its previous all time high levels. The stock has seen a major activity in terms of open interest addition on breakout indicating lot of long accumulation is happening. Technically this stock is poised for a fresh move towards Rs 85-86 levels, so one can initiate a long position in Ashok Leyland keeping a stoploss below Rs 75 and on upside can expect a target of Rs 85-86 level.\n", "title": "Super Six stocks that can boost your portfolio on July 21", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocksviews/super-six-stocks-that-can-boost-your-portfoliojuly-21_2062441.html", "time": "8.49 am "}, {"date": " 20 Jul 2015", "content": "Jul 20, 2015, 12.14 PM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nApollo Tyres' Q1 results on August 11, 2015\nApollo Tyres Ltd has informed BSE that a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company will be held on August 11, 2015, for consideration of Un-audited Financial Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (Q1).\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nApollo Tyres Q1 results on August 11, 2015\nApollo Tyres Ltd has informed BSE that a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company will be held on August 11, 2015, for consideration of Un-audited Financial Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (Q1).\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nApollo Tyres Ltd has informed BSE that a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company will be held on August 11, 2015, for consideration of Un-audited Financial Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (Q1).In this connection, as per the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Code of conduct for Prohibition of Insider Trading, the trading window for dealing in securities of the Company will remain closed for all directors/officers/designated employees of the Company from July 20, 2015 to August 13, 2015 (both days inclusive).Source : BSE\n", "title": "Apollo Tyres' Q1 results on August 11, 2015", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/announcements/apollo-tyres-q1-resultsaugust-11-2015_2045801.html", "time": "12.14 pm "}, {"date": " 20 Jul 2015", "content": "Jul 20, 2015, 12.44 PM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nHere are Rahul Shah's top trading ideas\nWatch the interview of Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Securities with Ekta Batra & Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18, in which he shared his readings and outlook on Futures and Options (F&O) side of the market, specific stocks and sectors.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nHere are Rahul Shahs top trading ideas\nWatch the interview of Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Securities with Ekta Batra & Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18, in which he shared his readings and outlook on Futures and Options (F&O) side of the market, specific stocks and sectors.\nPost your opinion here\nWatch the interview of Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Securities with Ekta Batra & Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18, in which he shared his readings and outlook on Futures and Options (F&O) side of the market, specific stocks and sectors.\nBelow is the verbatim transcript of Rahul Shah's interview with CNBC-TV18\nApollo Tyres\n\"We have seen some kind of momentum gathering in tyre stocks and longs getting added.

In the last series we have seen the strong buying interest from the foreign institutional investor (FIIs) and heavyweight stock started upmove. Now we are expecting that midcap and smallcap counter may continue their movement.\u00a0 Apollo Tyres is moving after the consolidation of last three series. Earlier it was finding hurdle near to the Rs 243, on Friday when Nifty fell down the stock crossed and closed above the hurdle of Rs 243. Now this stock is all set to move towards Rs 260 on the higher side. We are expecting the higher volatility, we have major events like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policy, gross domestic product (GDP) estimation, IIP data and the Budget in the series, so we are turning bit cautious and trading on the option and option strategy to play safe with the limited risk. So here suggesting the bull Call spread, buy 240 Call and sell 260 Call. In the entire strategy the risk would be around 8 point. As per the view this stocks moves to Rs 260 levels than we will get profit near to Rs 24,000.\nReliance Capital \u00a0is making the base formation. This stock is now showing early sign of bottom out formation. It is moving after the consolidation of last 16 trading sessions. We are expecting a strong short covering in the counter as by its nature and the derivatives data. We are suggesting to go for the bull Call spread. Buy 500 Call and sell 520 Call, in the entire strategy risk would be around 7 points that is the Rs 3,500 per strategy. As per the view if the stock moves towards Rs 520 than we will get profit of around Rs 6,500. So 1:2 risk reward ratio and this stock is now showing some sign of the bounce back move towards Rs 520-525 level as per its price nature.\n", "title": "Here are Chandan Taparia's top trading ideas", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/marketoutlook/herechandan-taparias-top-trading-ideas_1289411.html", "time": "9.41 am "}, {"date": " 19 Jan 2015", "content": "Jan 19, 2015, 10.26 PM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nApollo Tyres Q3 results on Feb 06, 2015\nApollo Tyres has informed that a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company will be held on February 06, 2015 for consideration of Un-audited Financial Results for the quarter and nine months period ended December 31, 2014 (Q3).\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nApollo Tyres Q3 results on Feb 06, 2015\nApollo Tyres has informed that a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company will be held on February 06, 2015 for consideration of Un-audited Financial Results for the quarter and nine months period ended December 31, 2014 (Q3).\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nApollo Tyres Ltd has informed BSE that a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company will be held on February 06, 2015 for consideration of Un-audited Financial Results for the quarter and nine months period ended December 31, 2014 (Q3).In this connection, as per the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Code of conduct for Prohibition of Insider Trading, the trading window for dealing in securities of the Company will remain closed for all directors/officers/designated employees of the Company from January 20, 2015 to February 07, 2015 (both days inclusive).Source : BSE\n", "title": "Apollo Tyres Q3 results on Feb 06, 2015", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/announcements/apollo-tyres-q3-resultsfeb-06-2015_1278388.html", "time": "10.26 pm "}, {"date": " 13 Jan 2015", "content": "Jan 13, 2015, 09.12 AM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nHere are top 10 stocks to focus on January 13\nHere are top 10 stocks to focus on January 13 - Cairn India, Jet Airways, Apollo Tyres, Ceat, Crompton Greaves, Bank Nifty, Hindalco, CMC, Clariant Chemicals and Spicejet.

What is the pick of the pack, what catches your eye?\nA: This time there is a particular company, which has not reported great numbers and I would still want to buy it. In fact because of that I want to buy it and this is\u00a0 Escorts because we have seen not only is that VRS component of the Rs 32 crore taken off the bottomline to some extent, the margins haven\u2019t been in line with what the street was expecting. This is because the improvement that the company is talking about, having started in all segments, is just restricted to tractors right now.\nThe big component of its sales now will be from the earthmoving equipment and the construction equipment which is a huge area of margin growth for them.\nIt hasn\u2019t yet taken a bit - the kind of order flow that we expect with some of these smaller companies like ACE Construction, Escorts, JCB\u2019s alliance with Escorts has always been a market leader of sorts for them but I think that is an area that is going to be very promising as margins improve.\nQ: The construction business losses this time too have doubled and so, don\u2019t you think there are better opportunities in the market?\nA: There are, but Escorts\u2019 on a standalone basis is going through a lot of turnaround pains. So this is going to happen, what TVS went through a year back and what\u00a0 Ashok Leyland went through six months back, so you need to look at the bottoming out of the earnings cycle and Escorts at Rs 152 - and that is the reason it came down from Rs 176 to Rs 150. So it is an ideal opportunity.\nQ: Construction is just a tenth of their number, so would you pin your hopes on that one?\nA: No, tractor is already one area that is growing.\nQ: You expect it to do well?\nA: Yes. It didn\u2019t do well this quarter but if you see vis-\u00e0-vis\u00a0 Mahindra then Swaraj , their brand recall has always been higher and if there is any sort of trigger that everybody is counting on at some stage will happen then the valuation will definitely change dramatically in this.\nQ: We have lot of results reaction, Do you like Apollo Tyres ?\nA: Yes, the saving on the input side and the kind of growth that it has clocked, replacement market, all of it kind of converges to bring Apollo into a sweet spot of sorts.\nAlso, there is a significant upside from here. Ceat is also in the same zone but Apollo is definitely one stock that should see some more ownership coming from institutional side.\nQ: The more important or compelling auto ancillary company at this moment is Motherson Sumi . Were you convinced by the management\u2019s explanation of why their margins were a bit under the weather, why the numbers were a tad short of estimates?\nA: Quite understandable. I don\u2019t think it is such a cause of concern. Of course we always feel that this stock had run up too ahead of expectations but that happened, there will always be a bit of a lag between numbers coming.\nYou also need to look at the Gabriel numbers, these are quiet performers that come out of the blue and give you such kind of stellar performance but under that shadow you also have the Munjal twins, the Munjal Showa , Munjal Auto , they are also very encouraging. They supply to Hero Motocorp .\nHero Motocorp is growing at such a phenomenal rate but we have not discounted this, they are still available at the same discounting as last one year and so, these are certain things you need to look at. The headline auto ancillary players will always be overvalued but you need to look at one level below that.\nQ: Is Munjal Showa one level below?\nA: Yes, because it is not something that goes to all OEMs unlike\u00a0 Gabriel which is like a market leader but even for a captive market it definitely has a lot of growth into it.\nQ: What about TVS Srichakra , that one rallied 20 percent yesterday?\nA: Yes, it is one of those scarcity premium that it is getting. They are into those low cost tyre, which is also likely to take off now but it is a bit overdone. It is not a segment that you can rely on from a very long-term perspective.\nQ: What about Bharat Forge ?\nA: This is the company that has been struggling since last two years to set so many things right, in terms of its acquisition, in terms of its operational efficiencies but getting all of that to do so well.\nNow with the defence area opening up to Bharat Forge, it is something where the capacities would start looking very meagre, till last year we were worried about the huge capacities that built up with this but this is not much of use.\nToday, if the defence contract starts coming its way in whichever form, it could probably begin with the artillery side of the defence production and if that happens, Bharat Forge could probably be again have to revalue it.\nIt is phenomenal, we don\u2019t need to worry about the kind of run up that is there, you can still kind of dip into it.\nQ: Would you buy\u00a0 Amtek Auto at this price?\nA: The management wants to take a pause, they want to consolidate and everybody is questioning whether at such a high leverage, the valuations could get further richer. But the group is a market leader in whichever segment, geography and product segment it has been present in.\nTherefore, another two quarters and this stock could again see a significant run up begin there. In between you would see a few dips that would be an opportunity like Escorts buying into whenever there is a sentimental or a technical correction otherwise it is definitely a long on both the stocks.\nQ: Outside the auto pack, what has impressed you?\nA: We have discovered one interesting stock. This is also an area that has got a lot of attention and that is white goods and household appliances.\nThere is a company called\u00a0 Singer which all of us believe as a multinational but is only into sewing machines. They have expanded into things like food processors, induction cookers, irons, stuff which is very easily amenable to their value change.\nSinger\u2019s sewing business is a leadership business but doesn\u2019t fetch that kind of a premium as yet because the company is not very active in the market, it is just about Rs 200 crore market cap.\nIf it were to start getting more visible, use its distribution chain to start supplying, the same things which it manufactures, look at what Whirlpool, Symphony or Voltas or any other related company gets.\nMore money in the pockets of people, this is one segment that is very promising and people still associate Singer as a very strong MNC brand but it is actually a home grown brand.\nQ: The previous quarters numbers were quite strong. Rs 65 crore of revenues versus Rs 40 crore last time and about doubling of profits.\nA: I was quite surprised to see the way they have - it is an unsung hero. One of the machines is a global patented stuff, which is that zigzag sewing machine, which still remains to be the one which people haven\u2019t yet tracked and earlier they used to have a lot of support from the European markets, all the fashion industry was depended on their equipment but it had a slowdown.\nThey have diversified at the right time, the Jammu plant re-started in 2013 and so, it has kind of come up to capacity, hasn\u2019t got affected by the floods and that also we checked out.\nThey are not high priced but very high on quality. That is what they position themselves at.\nPressure cooker is a new diversification but putting it in that category, certainly the P/E multiple band goes differently. It is more institutional now.\n", "title": "Here's what Altamount Cap is betting on post Q2 earnings", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/resultanalysis/heresaltamount-cap-is-bettingpost-q2-earnings_1224559.html", "time": "9.12 am "}, {"date": " 11 Nov 2014", "content": "Nov 11, 2014, 10.33 AM  | Source: CNBC-TV18\nHere are top 10 stocks to keep an eye on November 11\nHere are top 10 stocks to keep an eye on November 11 - DLF, Power Grid, Shriram Transport, M&M Financial, Apollo Tyres, Jain Irrigation, Hindalco, Jyoti Structures, HCC and Amtek Auto.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nHere are top 10 stocks to keep an eye on November 11\nHere are top 10 stocks to keep an eye on November 11 - DLF, Power Grid, Shriram Transport, M&M Financial, Apollo Tyres, Jain Irrigation, Hindalco, Jyoti Structures, HCC and Amtek Auto.\nPost your opinion here\n", "title": "Here are top 10 stocks to keep an eye on November 11", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocksviews/heretop-10-stocks-to-keepeyenovember-11_1224548.html", "time": "8.31 am "}, {"date": " 10 Nov 2014", "content": "Nov 10, 2014, 09.53 PM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nApollo Tyres: Announces Q2 results\nApollo Tyres has announced the results for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 The Unaudited results for the Quarter ended September 30, 2014.

So what would you do?\nBaliga: Apollo clearly, I have been saying this for a while, tyre stocks clearly it is time to book out because this is the best stage for the tyre sector. Raw material prices have come down, tyre prices have not. The next stages where the tyre prices also start coming down because of competition, margin reduces. The stage after that raw material prices start moving up, tyre prices stay where they are, that is the worst stage. So that can happen possibly in the next two and half to three years but if the best stage is more or less done, it is played out.\nSenthil: So this is across the sector not just Apollo?\nBaliga: Yes, of course. Absolutely.\nAnuj: Valuation wise it is still signal digit price earnings?\nBaliga: Valuation wise it can never get into double digits because again, if you are talking of FY16, I am talking of possibly about Rs 23-24 Earnings per share (EPS) for Apollo. So maximum upside for the stock would be Rs 230-240 but then when you are talking of the third stage which I just talked about, when you have the rubber prices and the other raw material prices going up but tyre prices staying where they are you have the margins getting squeezed and\u00a0this Rs 23 can come down to Rs 10.\nWe have seen that in the past; you see in the last ten years for the tyre stocks look at what happened in 2011-13, that was a time to possibly buy. At that point of time in 2012 it was great time to buy CEAT. Rs 95-100 and no one was even looking at it but at Rs 800 everyone wants to buy it.\nSenthil: What is your view on Apollo?\nMehta: In fact we had done some channel checks just a few days back, to be precise four days back, with few of the dealers of\u00a0 Apollo Tyres and what data we collected from them says that the sales as well as the demand has been quite robust and in the last two years volume growth from the replacement segment was around 5-6 percent which is right now around 10-11 percent and they expect mid double digit growth in the coming days. So probably the replacement demand as well as the Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) demand has been robust.\nAnother thing that one needs to look at is rubber prices has set a historic low around 4-5 year low plus there is another thing that is very important is that the vehicle sales figures have been quite robust in the past months and the festive season has just begun. So we feel that probably Apollo Tyres which is one of the most sought of and undervalued stock if you consider it on a PE valuation also on the tyre universe where\u00a0 CEAT has given around 8 times returns Apollo has given just around 4 times and if you compare it to a stock like JK which has also grown six fold there is still some upside to go though I wouldn\u2019t suggest somebody to buy it aggressively but it would be a stronghold from our side at least on Apollo Tyre front. The Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) limit being raised to 40-45 percent is also adding sort of sentiment booster for the stock.\nMenaka: But it is only a sentiment booster, because we checked and the FII investment as of now in that stock is 44 percent or something. So there is very little headroom really left of any sort. So it is quite literally only a sentiment boost?\nMehta: Exactly it is just a sentiment boost as I said for that but overall as I said the OEM as the replacement demand has started to grow and that will augur well for this stock going forward.\nMenaka: That is a fair point. I wanted to bring the demand point for you as well. Are you discounting or are you ignoring the upsurge in demand that many people are expecting now that the auto business is in turnaround mode?\nBaliga: This is exactly what I said two years back. This is the reason why you should have been looking at tyre stocks at that point of time. OEMs are going to squeeze you. There is no way you can make extra margins from OEMs just because rubber prices have come down. You will make money on the replacement market and that is what is being factored in right now.\nSenthil: So do you think it is all played out?\nBaliga: It is all played out. In the next two or three months you will have tyre prices coming down. Competition is there and there is extra capacity. So clearly prices will come down. Always there is a time lag between the tyre prices coming down or tyre prices going up and the rubber prices and other raw material prices.\nSenthil: Where in the cycle of fall of rubber prices and tyre prices are we do you think? How much more can rubber prices fall or have we bottomed out there?\nMehta: The best judgement of the take is that all the commodity prices are generally trending southwards and we see no reason why rubber prices would probably tend to go up from here. So at least if the rubber prices stay where they are which is around Rs 121/kg which has been at around 14 month is making lows continuously. So if rubber prices stay where they are, if the realisation stay where they are there is going to be great replacement demand that would creep into.\nAnother important factor is that we are somewhere around the mid cycle of the tyre stocks going up and we feel that there is at least one leg with it which still remains for stocks like Apollo Tyres which on a relative basis are undervalued than other tyre stocks. So it wouldn\u2019t be a general call to hold all the tyre stocks but for Apollo Tyres it would surely be a hold as well as a buy on dips strategy that we would suggest to viewers and clients.\n", "title": "Apollo Tyres quadrupled in last 15 mths, will you sell it?", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocksviews/apollo-tyres-quadrupledlast-15-mths-will-you-sell-it_1197566.html", "time": "4.27 pm "}, {"date": " 01 Oct 2014", "content": "Oct 02, 2014, 12.14 PM  | Source: PTI\nFIIs can buy up to 45% stake in Apollo Tyres: RBI\nThe RBI monitors the ceilings on FII/NRI/PIO investments in Indian companies on a daily basis.

It is around nine percent against 11 percent or 12 percent in case of MRF. In case of valuations it is the cheapest, says Mehraboon Irani of Nirmal Bang.\nPost your opinion here\n02:30 pm\nJK Tyre and Industries is the cheapest of all tyre stocks, does it deserve to trade at higher valuations?\nBelow is the transcript of Mehraboon Irani and Dipan Mehta\u2019s interview with CNBC-TV18's Sonia Shenoy and Senthil Chengalvarayan.\nSonia: Ceat has run up substantially, so has Apollo Tyres. If you look at the performance of JK Tyre and Industries, this week it has been exceptional; it is a 30 percent gain this week. But do you think given the valuation gap that it has perhaps the gap could narrow?\nIrani: I personally feel the gap is justified but if you are asking me purely from the stock price angle it is distinctly possible looking at the volumes and the count over the last three days the way the stock has gone and momentum picking up people are now discussing the stock more. Like earlier I used to mention in tyres people would mention\u00a0 Ceat , MRF \u00a0and Apollo Tyres . Now people are also mentioning JK Tyre and Industries . In that particular case the discounting could possibly narrow a little bit.\nThe EBIDT margin, if you take among the four top players, it is the lowest in JK Tyre. It is around nine percent against 11 percent or 12 percent in case of MRF. In case of valuations it is the cheapest, yes but the EBIDT margin is the lowest. Its balance sheet is strained with Rs 2,500 crore debt and if you take an earning pressure next year of around Rs 80, the stock going at around 6p vis-\u00e0-vis MRF which is going at around 10.5p, if you look at FY16 earnings. We are looking at MRF having an earnings per share (EPS) of around Rs 3,200 in 2016. At Rs 31,700 or Rs 31,800 it is the best stock to buy.\nIn the next two years if tyre prices remain at the same level where they are, I won\u2019t be surprised if MRF is a Rs 50,000 stock; lovely balance sheet, Rs 3,100 EPS, all going for MRF according to me and they are also planning to take an entry into the international markets, a little bit more aggressively because more or less right now it is a domestic player.\nI always believed in preferring companies which don\u2019t have strain in the balance sheet and MRF with its pedigree, and let\u2019s not forget, MRF is one company which, if you check up with tyre dealers they will tell you that they don\u2019t believe in price cut, they don\u2019t believe in discounts being offered, they don\u2019t believe in too much of price cuts, they have a super brand.\nSo, if have to select one stock despite slightly higher valuations vis-\u00e0-vis JK Tyre, I would still stick to MRF.\nSonia: What is your view? Do you also believe that it is justified the valuation discount that JK trades at and one should not buy it at this point?\nMehta: I completely agree with Mr Mehraboon Irani. I can\u2019t find any fault with his logic over there and just as he spoke about MRF which appears to be his favourite tyre company, we can leave aside JK Tyre and I can talk about my favourite tyre company which is Balkrishna Industries . If you look at the track record of that company, it has been fabulous over the past 3-4 years and they have a differentiated business models where it doesn\u2019t supply to run of the mill automobile industry but is more into off the road (OTR) tyres which go into construction and industrial equipment. So, one would prefer such companies rather than laggards such as JK Tyre. Past track record plays a very important role.\nSenthil: The question we are asking is not whether the valuation gap is justified but given current state of euphoria, given the current state of people looking for bargains, leaving aside the fundamentals, do you anyway see JK Tyre narrowing valuation gaps?\nMehta: No, I don't think so. The valuation gaps may continue to remain and although the P/E multiple in absolute number may go up but that is possibly because the entire tyre industry valuation and P/E multiple has moved up. So market has its own way of differentiating companies by assigning them high or low P/E multiples depending upon a lot of qualitative factors and although investors can look at the arbitrage opportunities, which means that hopefully the P/E multiple of JK Tyre will start moving up to around about the industry averages but in my experience, that usually doesn't happen and markets always tend to distinguish between good companies and bad companies within the same industry.\nSenthil: He mentioned Balkrishna, they have got a unique model off-road, they have got a model of manufacturing in various countries -- do you think this whole scenario of hyper competitiveness, foreigners coming in, MRF's conservativeness could be a factor that could see it lose market share, it could see it gets less nimble?\nIrani: I think they are certainly a risk factors. You have rightly pointed it out but then somewhere along the line, you believe -- you give a benefit of doubt over there, that company which has been there for so many years will possibly take care of all these things which come in its way. I think yes, foreign competition is a threat of MRF and to most of the tyre players so whether the company will possibly endure it, face it and come out strongly, I personally think it will be yes. But I definitely agree with Dipan's choice Balkrishna. In fact if I have to take two stocks it will be MRF and Balkrishna. Dipan will have Balkrishna at number one and MRF at possibly number two, I will definitely have Balkrishna at close number two.\nSonia: In terms of market share, do you think JK Tyres - it is anyway the leader in the truck and bus radial segment with about 35 percent market share and given that the bus business is picking up with Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors etc are getting a lot of bus orders, do you think that JK Tyre could benefit on account of that and perhaps gain more ground in terms of market share?\nIrani: I would say that Dipan brought out the point very well. It is the past of the company also. What happens is basically the momentum can take this stock higher. I definitely feel that the discounting could narrow down but over a period of one year, I think this discounting will be back where it is right now.\nNumber two is ultimately the end of it all, at the present valuations, which are not very expensive but you are talking of rubber prices being benign at the same level for a period of 12-15-18 months that is a great assumption. Right now what is happening is in Vietnam and Thailand and the way the rubber has been produced fine, rubber prices are under pressure, will they be in the pressure 12-14 months later? If they move up marginally, you can expect the discount to possibly widen over a period of one year because at that point of time people will go back to MRF, people will go back to Balkrishna and people may go back to Apollo. So other tyre companies may take a backseat at that point of time. So it is great. All the stocks definitely catch up in terms of valuation to some extent in a market in which all factors are in favour. Rubber is 45 percent of the raw material cost of tyre companies. So that is fine. It is distinctly possible.\nBut if you are buying the stock knowing fully well that rubber is at all time low, stocks have gone up too sharply, what should I buy? You possibly prefer to stick to MRF, Balkrishna and Apollo was in my list but what it did last year, it is something which has left a bitter taste. So I would stick between these two despite the fact that JK Tyre would give me definitely a slightly better appreciation in the shorter term vis-\u00e0-vis at this relatively.\n", "title": "Does JK Tyre deserve to trade at higher valuations?", "link": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocksviews/does-jk-tyre-deserve-to-trade-at-higher-valuations_1183662.html", "time": "4.55 pm "}, {"date": " 18 Sep 2014", "content": "Sep 18, 2014, 09.21 AM  | Source: Moneycontrol.com\nApollo Tyres confirms Hungary as location for its first Greenfield facility outside India\nAfter receiving the necessary approval from its board of directors, on the proposed investment towards setting-up a Greenfield facility in Eastern Europe, Apollo Tyres today confirmed Hungary as the location for the same.\nLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3\nApollo Tyres confirms Hungary as location for its first Greenfield facility outside India\nAfter receiving the necessary approval from its board of directors, on the proposed investment towards setting-up a Greenfield facility in Eastern Europe, Apollo Tyres today confirmed Hungary as the location for the same.\nPost your opinion here\n\u00a0\nApollo Tyres Ltd has informed BSE regarding a Press Release dated September 17, 2014, titled \"Apollo Tyres confirms Hungary as the location for its first Greenfield facility outside India\".

London is home for you now. What does India look like now that you paid a visit back after the new government has taken over?\nA: India today at least when I am in London there is a lot of positive noise of India being back on track. A lot of investments, I see the same guys who were saying that they were very negative about the economy and very negative about the country for business are now becoming more and more positive. Everyone is still sitting on the boundary line. They are still waiting and watching on when is the right move to come into the country.\nQ: So they are waiting for concrete decisions to be taken by this government in terms of policy?\nA: In terms of policy, we are seeing that there is something actually happening at the ground level, implementation of policies, opening up of infrastructure. The government has made all the pro growth noises and one has to see whether they are going to be implemented physically on the ground and that is what the world is waiting to watch to see.\nQ: How confident are you feeling about the auto sector because after a painful 12 months the passenger car business seems to have started to see a turn around, we have seen three months of consistent growth coming in for the passenger car segment, commercial vehicles still looking not so good and the prescription from commercial vehicle manufacturers seems to suggest that at least another two quarters before we will see some real visible turnaround in the sector. What is your own sense?\nA: The passenger segment has started like you are saying it has started growing but we need to see a whole six month period of how the passenger vehicle will grow. We are now running up to Diwali and that is the main season to see pre Diwali, post Diwali what happens.\nSo there is a general tendency for people to buy before Diwali but post Diwali is that curve still going up and the trend still going up this is what we need to see. As far as commercial vehicle (CV) is concerned we are seeing signs of a growth coming in from before, not that they have reached their peak because peak was in 2011. They are nowhere close to that vehicle manufacturing.\nQ: Only the deceleration has stopped at this point in time in a sense?\nA: Yes, so they are coming back up but again, like I said people are waiting to watch. Once the infrastructure growth project starts then you will see CV booming but there is a lot to be seen on the ground. As far as farm is concern and that is a big concern for us. Farm sector is really down. The Q1 was very bad and Q2 has even seen worse.\nQ: Speaking of challenge and problems and you announced your results a short while ago. There was a fair degree of volatility as far as your stock was concerned and there is a mixed set of opinions on the street; some positive and some not so positive. Let me get you to address some of the concerns that investors have. I am bringing up the concerns that brokerages who have a sell call on Apollo Tyres have raised. Let me start by getting you to address them one by one. The first concern is the increasing focus of multinational companies and technological advantages in truck, bus and radials which would results in a market share loss for domestic players like yourselves. Do you believe that this is an exaggerated threat or do you believe that you are well poised both on the technology R&D front or do you really see an erosion as far as your market share is concerned on an account of competitive pressure?\nA: As far as India for Apollo is a concern I can talk about myself. We are very well positioned as far as technology and products are concerned and why I say that is today our truck radial product has grown 25 percent Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y). We have a brand new facility in Chennai which is up and running which is reaching terminal capacities. We have garnered market share, we are today clearly the leaders at around 30 percent market share in the Indian truck market.\nIf you see competition, multinational specifically, they all are here. Michelin has put up a plant in Chennai; Bridgestone is putting up a plant in Pune. So we have all of them here. As far as technology is concerned today customer\u2019s voice is the main voice and that shows in the market leadership and the price positioning.\nToday I will not say we are clearly the leaders in price because there would be a gap of 1 percent from the international competition but we are clearly the market leaders and that shows in the technology that we have created for our products for our customers in India.\nQ: Will you be able to hold prices?\nA: Not the prices but even the market share. What we have gone and done is we have created a customer centric force team within India which is really looking at customers and working along with the customers to educate them the benefits of having a truck radial. We operate with them in their markets also; for instance in Europe we are competing with the best multinationals over there in Europe.\nWe have learnt our way on how to compete with the multinationals. I don't see us losing market shares at all in India. This is our home turf we are only going to make it more stronger and stronger as we go up in the ladder. In fact we are even making a decision to expand our truck radial capacity because today truck is running for us at around 85-90 percent utilisation and we see a big wave of radialisation coming in the industry in the years to come. Today radialisation is around 30 percent in truck. We believe in three to four years it will be 50 percent and the company is well poised to look after that growth and that is what we believe we will be able to keep up with and compete with the multinational.\nQ: Since you are talking about expansion then you are obviously talking about capital expenditure as well. One of the other concerns is the enabling resolution that you have already had cleared from your board to raise about USD 200 million either by way of debt or equity, do you really need to through with this at this point in time because you are generating enough cash?\nA: We have taken an enabling resolution up to USD 200 million. So, we have an expansion programme of around Rs 1500 crore for the truck radial to remain as leaders in the truck market and this is a profitable business for us. So, we are generating double EBITDA margins through selling truck radials and through the Chennai facility. So, that is a positive for us.\nWe are also looking at restructuring our Kerala unit which are very old units running on old technology. So, we are going into off-highway tyres (OHT) which is industrial, OTR, floatation tyres, agri tyres, which will incur a capex of around Rs 500 crore.\nQ: So, altogether about Rs 1,900-2,000 crore.\nA: Yes. Rs 2000 crore and this is to be spent over the next three years. So, nothing here and now that we have taken an enabling resolution. This is something that will give us strength to go and do these capital expenditures.\nQ: What would you prefer debt or equity because there are concerns on equity dilution?\nA: As a promoter I can tell you we are looking at equity coming in.\nQ: How much would that mean in terms of dilution?\nA: We have not finalised the number right now, we are still studying the market. We are in no rush to go and pick up this USD 200 million.\nQ: What would be the tentative timeline that you could look at for this fund raising?\nA: We have a one-year window and that is what we are operating in.\nQ: The markets are doing well at this point in time, I would imagine that you would want to go through with it sooner rather than later?\nA: Not really because I see a huge rush in the market to go and pick up money and you have seen a lot of money has been raised in the past two months. So, I am in no rush. I need to see the right price. That is when Apollo will come out.\nQ: You were hoping that Cooper would give you a big leg-up as far as the global tyre pecking order is concerned. That obviously did not go through, so how does that change your aspirations on the global map?\nA: I am not in the race of getting up the pecking order.\nQ: But you have said that several times over, I want to be in the top 10 [globally] by 2016.\nA: I have gone away from that because I have learnt a lot.\nQ: What is the target for you -- and I am not talking to you about a short term target, about the next 12 or 24 months because a lot of these things won't even kick-in by then \u2013 but is there a five-year target?\nA: Right now there is no target in our minds right now because we are just putting these plans into place. Once these plans are totally ironed out then I can come out and say that this is my five-year target.\nWe are looking at a 2020 target which will be fueled by organic growth and obviously it might [also] be something inorganic we would look at.\nQ: But the preferred option at this point in time is organic growth?\nA: Yes, 100 percent.\nQ: So by 2020 will you be in the top-10?\nA: I hope so.\nApollo Tyres stock price\nOn December 18, 2015, at  12:44 hrs Apollo Tyres was quoting at Rs 153.10, down Rs 0.4, or 0.26 percent.

In India, Apollo has its largest facility in Limda in Gujarat, two plants in the rubber producing Kerala and the latest next generation plant is near Chennai in Tamil Nadu.\nThese 4 have a combined production capacity of 1,400 tonnes a day. In South Africa, the Durban plant accounts for 90 tonnes and the Enschede plant in the Netherlands adds another 195 tonnes a day, taking the current production capacity to around 1,685 tonnes a day.\nThe company will also be investing Rs 1,500 crore in its plant at Chennai, where the capacity would be enhanced from 6,000 units per day to 9,000 units.\nIn Kerala, where Apollo has two plants at nearby Kalamassery and Perambra, the company would be investing Rs 500 crore in the next 2-3 years, he said. Already a new product category Off Highway Tyres (OHT) has been introduced and are producing 30 tonnes in Kalamassery unit.\nThe Kalamassery unit, set up in the fifties, needs to be converted to produce new product category, he said, adding that discussions on wage and productivity issues were on with the labour unions.\nPointing out that Apollo was keen to invest in Kerala, Kanwar said the trade unions have to be with us. There are mindset issues. \"We have to show them a larger picture. In principle they are willing.\"\n\u00a0\nKanwar said Apollo has set up operations in Thailand and has 22 employees catering South East Asia. Operations have also been started at Dubai, Australia and Brazil. The company would focus on R&D, Brands, Marketing and Technology, he said.\nAsked about inorganic growth plans for the company, he said there was nothing on the table right now. On the Indian Tyre market, he said with the new government coming in there is lot of sentiment that is positive.\n\"Right waves and right noises are being made\" and the recovery is expected in the second half of this fiscal in the tyre industry.\nOn the Rubber crisis, Kanwar said the rubber prices having softened and are at level tyre companies can afford.

A day after the announcement, the price of the Apollo Tyres stock, which is traded on the National Stock Exchange of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange, dropped from the previous day\u2019s close of Rs 92 to Rs 68.60 per share\nPost your opinion here\nAshish K Mishra/ Forbes India\nTHE DEAL THAT WASN\u2019T\nThe USD 2.5 billion Apollo-Cooper marriage was called off before they could say\n\u2018I do\u2019. Both parties are aggrieved, and everyone, it seems, is to blame. Together, they would have become the 7th largest tyre company in the world. But, as this reconstruction of events indicates, they let the roadblocks puncture that ambition.\nNeeraj Kanwar was having a moment. On a holiday. In London. On December 30, 2013.\nThe 40-year-old managing director of the USD 2.4 billion Apollo Tyres , India\u2019s largest tyre company, Kanwar had had a tumultuous year. Travelling for over 130 days, he had been holed up mostly in the US where Apollo Tyres was painstakingly trying to acquire Cooper Tire & Co. It was a year when he had spent most of his time explaining, negotiating and strategising escape routes out of one crisis to another; when he was surrounded by people he didn\u2019t quite trust, one of whom even took him to court and questioned his integrity in business.\nIn a two-decade-long professional career, his integrity was the one thing he took immense pride in. When alone, it was also a year that often forced him to contemplate his next move, in business, in the courts.\nBut back in the comfort of his London home, surrounded by his two children and wife, during lunch, Kanwar was having a moment\u2014of introspection, reflection. The year was finally coming to an end and he was glad. It was then that his mobile phone rang. The call was from a colleague in the US. \u201cHi, Neeraj. Cooper has called off the merger. Just announced,\u201d he was told.\nKanwar didn\u2019t react immediately. This was yet another \u2018surprise\u2019 in a year full of surprises. He got off the call quickly. Lunch had not yet been served. He got up to find a quiet corner. And called his dad.\nComing of age\nThe Apollo-Cooper merger was announced on June 12, 2013. A day after the announcement, the price of the Apollo Tyres stock, which is traded on the National Stock Exchange of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange, dropped from the previous day\u2019s close of Rs 92 to Rs 68.60 per share. A day later, it reached its 52-week low on concerns that Apollo was taking on too much debt to pay Cooper\u2014nearly USD 2.5 billion.\nThe Apollo management had expected this reaction. In fact, they had anticipated that the stock would actually touch Rs 50. That barrier was not breached but, still, Kanwar wanted to send out a message that he knew what he was getting into.\nOn June 14, a Friday, Apollo called a press conference at the Leela hotel in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi. Kanwar took centre stage, making a presentation, answering questions and always looking confident. His father Onkar Kanwar, 71, made a few statements and answered some questions but was happy to take the backseat. It was clear that the deal had also signalled a transition at Apollo.\nThe Cooper deal was Neeraj\u2019s coming of age moment. The senior Kanwar said of his son, \u201cWatch out for him. He also has the fire in the belly like I had in my younger days.\u201d\nNeeraj was convinced that the Apollo-Cooper merger would result in the perfect global tyre company. From a geographical perspective, Apollo was already big in India, Europe and Africa. Cooper was established in North America and China. In terms of products, Apollo had made inroads into getting contracts with car companies like Volkswagen and General Motors. Cooper had significant presence and experience in the replacement tyre market. Compared to their individual insignificant market position (Cooper at No. 11 and Apollo at No. 17), after the merger, the combined entity would become the seventh largest tyre company in the world.\nIt would be fair to say that the vision has been shaped by the father. In the 1980s, Onkar Kanwar got the chance to study Cooper Tire & Rubber Co, an American tyre major. Focussed on replacement tyres, Cooper was a hugely profitable company. Kanwar\u2019s Apollo Tyres had a technical collaboration with General Tire International Co and on every visit to the US, the Indian businessman would hear about Cooper Tire. \u201cThey were making a lot of money. Coming back to India, I would tell my people to study this company,\u201d Kanwar told reporters of the time when Apollo was still a fledgling company, having just escaped closure in the previous decade.\nAnalysts and journalists, though, were not convinced. So Neeraj tried to temper the mood, saying, \u201cOnly USD 450 million of the total USD 2.5 billion debt for the deal would be serviced by its India business. The remaining debt of USD 2.1 billion is a non-recourse debt, taken on cash flows of Cooper and Vredestein [the European subsidiary of Apollo Tyres].\u201d It didn\u2019t matter. The Apollo share price fell by another 5.6 percent that day. The Kanwars, however, were positive that the market would eventually realise the value in the deal. Father and son had already booked tickets to the US to close all the remaining formalities with Cooper. For them, it was a done deal. They couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\nSitting in a factory in Rongcheng, a city in the extreme north east of China, a 51-year-old Chinese man had been keenly following the events which unfolded after the announcement by Apollo and Cooper. And he was seething with anger.\nTrouble in paradise\nNeeraj flew into Beijing to meet Che Hongzhi on May 15, four weeks before the formal announcement of the merger.\nChe, who is commonly referred to as Chairman Che, is the chairman of the Chengshan Group in China, which employs about 7,000 people in the city of Rongcheng. A former Communist Party member to boot, it would be fair to say that Che is a highly influential person. Cooper Tire has a joint venture with the Chengshan Group called Cooper Chengshan Tire Co, in which Cooper is the majority shareholder with a stake of 65 percent. Signed in 2006, this joint venture along with another facility (not part of this JV) contributes about 25 percent to Cooper\u2019s global annual sales turnover.\nIn the course of due diligence, Neeraj wanted to meet Che to ensure both partners understood each other and, more importantly, that Che was comfortable about working together in the future. Except that the meeting turned out to be a disaster.\nChe didn\u2019t speak any English. Neeraj didn\u2019t speak Chinese. Both had brought along translators. Since the meeting was set up by Cooper, two senior officials from the company were in attendance\u2014Hal Miller, president of international business, and Allen Tsaur, vice president of Asia operations. Neeraj was accompanied by his legal advisor, a representative from Sullivan & Cromwell. Neeraj told Che about Apollo being in advanced talks to acquire Cooper, about how both companies are a great fit and how the China business is a critical part of the deal.\nChe listened patiently but wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cI\u2019ve been a good son and the father is good. Now the father is divorcing me and the stepfather is coming in,\u201d he said. Neeraj was baffled. He continued to outline the benefits of the merger but Che kept on repeating his issue with the \u201cstepfather\u201d. Che\u2019s parting line: What was in this for him? If the merger was to go through, he would like to be compensated.\nAs revealing as this statement was, Neeraj tried not to make much of it. Meanwhile, none of these questions came up for discussion: Was Che comfortable with working with Apollo? If not, could the issues be ironed out? If he wanted an exit, how much was he expecting for his share? If Che were to exit, could Apollo run the subsidiary in China on its own?\nFour weeks later, Neeraj went ahead and announced the merger anyway.\nIt wasn\u2019t a wise thing to do. And little did Neeraj know that Che had plans of his own. On June 15, three days after the announcement, Che was in the US at the invitation of Cooper, with a bid of his own to acquire the company. He bid USD 38 per share, USD 3 more than Apollo had. Cooper had its own reasons to believe that Che\u2019s financing sources were not as committed as Apollo\u2019s. Despite the higher bid, it decided to go ahead with Apollo. Che left the US feeling insulted.\nOn June 18, a few days after Che\u2019s sudden stunt in the US, the union at Cooper Chengshan Tire Company (CCT) sent an open letter to all Cooper employees criticising the merger. It said the acquisition was too highly leveraged and questioned Cooper\u2019s ability to meet the needs of its workers and customers. This was the beginning of what would be a chain of events that would ultimately put the whole deal in jeopardy. On June 21, the 5,000-odd workers at the plant went on a strike. They got back to work a week later but stopped manufacturing any Cooper-branded tyres. Both Cooper and Apollo realised that the disruption in China needed immediate attention. Since neither had seen this coming, it was now an open question of who would bell the cat.\nOn July 1, Cooper and Apollo\u2019s representatives met in the US to discuss a possible China strategy. Apollo stated upfront that this was Cooper\u2019s problem. Neeraj was not going to meet Che again. Cooper must convince Che to agree to the merger. There could be no talk of compensation. He must be talked into coming on board. Roy Armes, the CEO of Cooper, along with his representatives, met Che in China on July 10. But the meeting was a non-starter. Che was disappointed and frustrated when he learned that Armes had turned up with nothing concrete to offer. Armes went back to the US empty handed.\nA day later, CCT\u2019s union sent a letter to Standard Chartered Bank, one of the bankers for Apollo, asking that it reconsider its decision to finance the transaction because of \u201csignificant reputational risks to your bank amid such a complex situation!\u201d The next day, the union put out an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal questioning \u201cwho can guarantee the success of integration between Chinese culture and Indian culture?\u201d The same day, the CCT union went on strike again. The plant was shut indefinitely. A few weeks later, Cooper\u2019s managers were barred from entering the plant. They had no access to CCT\u2019s financial books or records.\nThe father had lost control over the son. And that\u2019s when the blame game began.\nThe Spat \u2013 Part I\nHowever na\u00efve this may seem, Apollo says that it took Cooper at face value; that throughout diligence, Cooper maintained that it had excellent relations with its partner in China and there would be no problem. \u201cRoy Armes and his whole team told us there will be no problem. Even if the guy is a little upset, we will manage it. We have a great relationship with him; we\u2019ve worked together for seven years,\u201d says Sunam Sarkar, chief financial officer of Apollo Tyres.\nSarkar should know. He\u2019s been part of the deal since day one. \u201cTo even conceive that the 65 percent shareholder of a company would not have access to his own plant and to his own financial records was, honestly, completely beyond conception,\u201d he adds.\nCooper, on the other hand, alleges that Apollo knew that Che was expecting to be compensated. That should have been included in the offer price made for Cooper. And it wasn\u2019t.\nIt gets worse. Even as all this was happening, Apollo had no clue that Che was one of the bidders in the race to acquire Cooper Tire. Subsequently, when Apollo did get to know (as late as October, but more on that later), the company alleges that this was one of the real reasons for Che\u2019s anger. \u201cPart of his anger was monetary and part of it was his face because he was asked to bid and he bid higher, but Cooper didn\u2019t consider it,\u201d says Sarkar.\nCooper denies any of this happened. \u201cThis meeting [on June 15 between the Cooper Chengshan Tire joint venture partner and Cooper executives] did not take place. No bid was received from Chengshan Group after the merger agreement was signed,\u201d the company told Forbes India in an emailed statement.\nBut there is no debate on the fact that China was a critical part of the deal. And now it was in a limbo.\nExperts believe that Apollo has no reason to feel cheated. Brian Quinn, a professor of law at Boston Law College, who has followed the case closely, says that under Federal law the directors of Cooper have an obligation to listen and evaluate any proposal that comes their way till the time they extinguish the rights of stockholders. \u201cIn the US these situations happen all the time. That might rub people the wrong way, but it is permitted under the law,\u201d he told Forbes India.\nTo complicate matters further, time was of the essence. While entering into the deal, Cooper and Apollo had set themselves a deadline of December 31 to close the transaction. Debt financing was dependent on Cooper providing all the financial records by mid-Nov\n\u201cWhat is strange is that this transaction had a very short fuse. Just six months,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cIn normal domestic US transactions, people give themselves a year, even 18 months, for difficult deals. In this case it looks like the partners felt that either there are no issues or if there are, it doesn\u2019t matter. We will get it done.\u201d\nThrough June, July and August, Cooper and Apollo continued to talk to each other to try and solve the CCT issue. They couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s when another issue which had been simmering under the radar flared up.\nOn August 1, United Steelworkers (USW), the union representing employees at Cooper\u2019s Findlay, Ohio, and Texarkana, Arkansas, plants, filed grievances, alleging that Cooper had violated its collective bargaining agreements by entering into the merger. If the deal has to go through, Apollo must negotiate a new contract with the union. They had sat through a few meetings with Cooper and Apollo but nothing concrete had emerged. So they would go to court.\u00a0\nForbes India reached out to David Jury of the United Steelworkers Union to answer a set of questions. On a call, he said, \u201cI am the legal representative of USW with Cooper. Please don\u2019t call me again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTrouble at home\nCooper Tire and USW don\u2019t have a history of getting along well. During the economic downturn of 2008, when fuel prices shot up and US car sales came to a screeching halt, Cooper found itself in the middle of a crisis. To tide over the tough economic environment, it faced a tough decision to shut down one of its four plants in the country. That\u2019s when 1,050 members of the USW union in Findlay, Ohio, agreed to give the company USD 30 million in concessions, in the form of pay cuts for new hires and reduced bonuses to keep the plant open. Subsequently, when the company\u2019s fortunes improved, in October 2011, USW appealed to the management to increase wages. Cooper said that if the plant had to remain cost competitive, that was not possible. The workers were not happy. Starting late November 2012, the Findlay plant remained in lockout for three months.\nIn that context, USW first made its displeasure (about the merger) known to Cooper executives in a meeting on July 8, 2013. Cooper explained to them the merits of the merger and tried to dissuade them from filing any grievance. On July 24, Sarkar along with other Apollo representatives travelled to Nashville, Tennessee, where the union has a regional head office, to meet with the USW. Sarkar says that it was a good meeting and he was surprised to see that USW had done its homework. \u201cThey spoke to our union leaders here in Kochi and they spoke to the works council in Europe to find out more about Apollo,\u201d says Sarkar. \u201cThey told us in as many words that we have done our diligence on Apollo and we are very comfortable dealing with them. We are actually glad that a company like you is taking over.\u201d\nNevertheless, the meeting didn\u2019t result in any settlement. Like with Che in China, Apollo hadn\u2019t come to the table with a compensation offer in mind. Instead, the company wanted to understand what it was getting into before committing to anything. On August 1, USW filed for grievances. Both Cooper and Apollo opposed the grievances and decided that any further negotiation between them and USW would take place only after arbitration, which they were sure of winning.\nBut five weeks later, on September 13, James Oldham, the arbitrator, ruled in favour of USW. The ruling said that Apollo must reach collective bargaining agreements with 2,500 USW locals at Cooper\u2019s plants in Findlay, Ohio, and Texarkana, Arkansas, before it can proceed with its acquisition of Cooper. The deal was on hold. Cooper was anxious because time was running out. Apollo was surprised. All bets were off.\nThe Spat \u2013 Part II\nAgain as part of due diligence, in early 2013, a particular clause in the union legal agreement between Cooper and USW suggested that it was possible that post the merger announcement, the union might raise a red flag\u2014they could have a say both in terms of fresh demands and a change of control in management. \u201cThere was a possibility assigned to it. When we raised it with the Cooper management, they said that in their view it didn\u2019t apply at all and they were very confident that they would be able to settle with USW,\u201d says Sarkar. If not, they were prepared to go for arbitration, which they were completely confident of winning, he adds, pointing out that no settlement value was factored in the USD 35 per share offer Apollo made for Cooper.\nCooper claims that during the extensive diligence, the company had informed Apollo of its historical, tumultuous relationship with USW and its likely reaction to the merger. Both parties had jointly agreed that first, it was unlikely that USW would go into arbitration and second, if it did then they would contest it. Both parties had agreed on the way forward. Relations between the two deteriorated further post arbitration.\nThe arbitrator ruled in favour of USW, and Onkar Kanwar, Neeraj and Sarkar quickly packed their bags for the US. The news reached them on a Saturday. On September 16, a Monday, both took a 2 am flight from New Delhi to New York. The next day they met with Cooper\u2019s executives to discuss the negotiation strategy. That meeting didn\u2019t go particularly well. Cooper claims that the first thing Apollo wanted to discuss was not the negotiating strategy with USW, but that the merger agreement would need to be re-negotiated considering the incremental costs which had come up\u2014namely Che and USW. Apollo denies any such discussion took place at this point.\nOn September 19, the sparring partners travelled to Nashville again to negotiate with USW. The union had ten demands, which included coverage of two other plants (not unionised) and one-time bonuses for all union members among several other conditions. By Apollo\u2019s estimate, the additional cost of meeting those demands was about USD 130-140 million. Before the negotiations began, Apollo claims that Cooper\u2019s estimate was just USD 10 million.\u00a0\nAt the meeting, there were about 30 people representing USW and eight people from Apollo and Cooper. The union put forward their demands. The Apollo-Cooper party would then break out to consult among themselves the implications of those demands. The proceedings continued the whole of Thursday and spilled over to Friday. By late evening on Friday (September 20), Cooper\u2019s representatives started fretting. Stanley Weiner, partner at Jones Day, an expert in labour matters, and Cooper\u2019s counsel, started pushing Neeraj to agree to the union\u2019s demands, at any cost. \u201cTheir behaviour at that meeting was hugely dysfunctional because their lawyer aggressively was trying to get us to agree to whatever USW was asking for,\u201d says Sarkar.\nThe company had scheduled a board meeting of its directors on September 30 to approve the merger. They wanted Apollo to settle with USW at any cost. Cooper felt that Apollo was not negotiating in good faith and was trying to delay closing the transaction.\nSarkar contends that Apollo was merely trying to find a way to work together, especially since the amount\u2014USD 150 million\u2014was not small change. \u201cIt is a question of affordability, long-term business sustainability, because whatever we agreed to would then go into union contracts which forever would have an implication on the company,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t ruled out anything. We recruited an actuarial specialist to advise us. I think any prudent businessman would have done the same. You can\u2019t commit to costs which you don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d\nNegotiations between Apollo and USW continued the whole of the next week. Apollo though told Cooper to keep out of the discussions. Their impatience wasn\u2019t helping. \u201cAt the end of the day, the arbitrator had given the responsibility to Apollo and USW to agree on a way forward,\u201d says Sarkar. Even though there was no resolution on the USW front, on September 30, the Cooper board cleared the merger. On October 2, Apollo and Cooper executives met again in New York.\nThe meeting began with the latest update on the USW situation. Roy Armes, the CEO of Cooper, wasn\u2019t happy that his executives weren\u2019t allowed to be a part of the negotiations. Neeraj said that if Apollo had to settle with USW, it would cost the company an additional USD 150 million. That translates roughly into a USD 2.5-a-share downward revision of the USD 35 per share offer price (65 million Cooper shares outstanding). \u201cWe need to revise the price,\u201d said Neeraj.\nArmes was furious. \u201cI am being asked to pay for something which I can\u2019t even negotiate\u2026 I can go back to my board for a buck but 2.5 bucks is a lot,\u201d Armes is believed to have said. And like many other meetings between these two partners, this one too ended in ambiguity. Armes\u2019s parting line to Neeraj, according to Apollo sources, was: \u201cYou will see a lot of legality flying around because we have to protect our shareholder interest but I wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\nTwo days later, on October 4, Cooper sued Apollo in the Chancery Court of Delaware. The charge: Apollo had buyer\u2019s remorse. It had breached the parties\u2019 merger agreement by not using \u201creasonable best efforts\u201d to close the transaction, but instead was trying to re-negotiate the deal price after labour unrest at various Cooper manufacturing facilities increased the likely cost of acquisition for Apollo. Cooper also sought an immediate implementation of the merger agreement, much before the closing date of December 31.\nThe legal suit was the final blow in this saga of distrust between the two partners. Once the matter was in the hands of lawyers, all communication between the two partners ceased.\nDid Apollo see it coming? Sarkar says it was out of the blue. \u201cPhysically there was nothing more we could have done. Cooper didn\u2019t have their financials in place and they knew that the banks needed the financials to be able to go to market. But they wanted to force this transaction,\u201d he says. The trial lasted about a month. On November 8, the Chancery Court of Delaware, Judge Sam Glasscock III ruled that Apollo had not breached the terms of its USD 2.5 billion deal to buy Cooper Tire. The ruling also rejected Cooper\u2019s buyer\u2019s remorse claim and that Apollo was dragging its feet on closing the deal.\nSarkar says Cooper completely misread Apollo\u2019s intentions. \u201cIt was the difference between the American professional mentality and the Indian promoter mentality. The American professional management thought, oh, Apollo\u2019s share price has crashed by 40 percent so these people will have a rethink on the deal,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. Promoter management always looks at longer term strategic benefits. Unfortunately in our case, American professional managements, who are so quarter-to-quarter focussed, saw it purely as, \u2018oh, these guys must be having buyer\u2019s remorse\u2019.\u201d\nCooper still believed it had a strong case, so it filed an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. And strange as this may seem, Apollo still wanted Cooper.\nThe last rescue act\nRongcheng, located close to the Yellow Sea, doesn\u2019t have an airport. The nearest is in a town called Weihai which is about a 45-minute drive away. The city is quite enterprising, though, and among the industries there is a large shipbuilding yard which is state-owned, an Arcelor steel coil plant and a few tyre companies.\nOn the night of November 11, three days after the court ruling, Onkar Kanwar, Neeraj and Sarkar left on a Singapore Airlines flight for Beijing. From Beijing they flew to Weihai. They got to Rongcheng at 11 AM on September 13. They checked into a government hotel, had lunch and began waiting anxiously for a special guest\u2014Chairman Che. Che along with his translator, lawyer and two other company executives arrived at 2.30 pm. It was a fairly difficult start to the meeting, say Apollo representatives present there.\n\u201cYou people have insulted me,\u201d he began.\nSenior Kanwar took charge. \u201cLegally, Apollo was not even allowed to have any direct interface with you given the fact that Cooper is your shareholder. The transaction we are doing is only a change in shareholding at the American level,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everything else below that remains exactly as it is. But if we have hurt you or insulted you in any way, I apologise on behalf of Cooper, on behalf of us.\u201d\nBy the end of the three-hour-long meeting, Che had mellowed down. He claimed that he had been taken for a ride by Cooper. A few years back, he had sold his 15 percent stake in the joint venture to Cooper and all he got was USD 18 million. The other pinprick was being rejected despite a higher bid than Apollo. Their meeting ended with Che inviting the Apollo team to come and visit his tyre plant the next day.\nOn November 14, Apollo executives along with Che took a long tour of the factory. Their next meeting was with the mayor of Rongcheng. It was followed by lunch and another meeting to discuss the way forward. Che laid out the options on the table. A 65:35 status quo joint venture, where Apollo would own 65 percent was out of question. Option 1: Going forward, he would like to have a majority stake in the venture, from 35 to 70 percent. Option 2: Apollo should buy him out and run the plant themselves. Apollo liked Option 2. But Sarkar says that there was a huge difference in valuation expectations. \u201cOur range was USD 142 to USD 200 million. He started at USD 500 million. We asked for a basis for that. But he said no, this is what my company is worth,\u201d he says. After some deliberations, he came down to USD 450 million. But that was it. Apollo left the negotiation table. It was not a price the company was willing to pay. \u201cFinding a way doesn\u2019t mean finding a way at any cost. It doesn\u2019t mean we will give USW USD 150 million. It doesn\u2019t mean we will give Chairman Che USD 400 million bucks. It has to be finding a sensible way forward,\u201d says Sarkar.\nOn December 16, the Delaware Supreme Court dismissed Cooper\u2019s appeal.\nOn December 18, Armes called Onkar Kanwar with a suggestion that both partners hold a conference call to discuss a post December 31 scenario. \u201cLet\u2019s find another way to do this,\u201d he said. The group got on to the call. A suggestion for extending the December 31 deadline was immediately rejected since the very nature of the acquisition had changed. What they agreed on is that a small team be formed at the earliest to look at the contours of a new deal. A four-member team was decided on. From Apollo: Sunam Sarkar and Gaurav Kumar, group head, corporate strategy and finance. From Cooper: Brad Hughes, vice president and CFO, and Hal Miller, president, the International Tire business.\nThis small group didn\u2019t have a single meeting post that call. The holiday season was upon them. On December 30, 7 am, Ohio time, Cooper announced that it had called off its merger with Apollo.\nA few minutes later, Neeraj Kanwar, in London, got the call. He said he was surprised and disappointed by the news.\nThe moment for the deal had passed.\nAdditional reporting by Prince Mathews Thomas\nThis story has been constructed from court documents, Securities and Exchange Commission filings by Cooper Tire, conversations with Apollo Tyre executives and independent experts. Despite repeated attempts, Cooper refused to engage, saying they \u201cwill not have any additional comment at this time\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a game changer and it is going to make the profit margins healthier, the company stronger\u201d\u00a0 -Neeraj Kanwar in an interview to CNBC TV18\n\u201cTo even conceive that the 65 percent shareholder of a company would not have access to his own plant was beyond conception,\u201d\u00a0 -Sunam Sarkar, CFO, Apollo Tyres\n\u201cIt is time to move our business forward.\u201d\u00a0 -Roy Armes\u2019s statement on the Termination of the Merger.\n\u201cChe is a man who has got his own convictions and he believes what he is doing is right.
